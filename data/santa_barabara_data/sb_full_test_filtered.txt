 I got a story to tell you
 I ll tell you the story
 oh gosh

 took a trip
 to Mexico City

 four to six months after my dad died
 he died in s ixty s
 December sixty seven
 sometime in sixty eight we took this trip
 we d been talking about it for a while

 we
 c think of the name of my hotel
 but we ended up in a fabulous hotel

 first night
 and the next morning
 who s a early riser anyhow
 was probably up four o'clock
 So
 cause it was not w the accommodation we were supposed to have had
 in Mexico is like
 you know
 the
 Well we ended up with a corner suite
 It was so big

 two bedrooms
 big bar
 it was circ
 And I remember the New York Yankees were training there
 the season opens in April
 Mickey Mantle
 and Whitey Ford and all of em
 I wish I'd been smart enough to know then that
 these baseball cards
 and those autographs
 three or four hundred dollars

 at any rate

 I went down there with a recorder
 We used to
 We had those things at the store
 that we used to use
 when we d go out of town and
 or
 We had four or five of em
 Mike had one
 from that financial guy
 Things sold at the time for about eight or nine hundred dollars
 Eight or ni ne hundr ed
 Eight
 Uh
 you got a very sophisticated one
 It was MRC some heavy son of a bitch MRC

 Had a pouch
 my wife had fallen in love
 with a
 Mexican artist by the name of Nierman
 Forgot his first name
 Mm
 His paintings sold
 f for generally
 a thousand dollars plus
 Which was
 for me
 A lotta money in those days
 I was
 no way I was gonna spend twe a thou
 Very splashy
 Albert and Marcia had one of his paintings
 they had
 They had
 I I don t know
 Many times and
 and they had his book
 and
 we got down there

 all over the place
 And

 we had a cab driver
 Uh
 wherever the place where the gold was
 Yeah
 some kinda city
 about hundred miles away
 anyway
 Well before that
 he took us around the city
 still got his card somewhere
 Slammed the damn door on this guy
 one day we took him down to wherever we went
 Buddy and Sue didn t go
 but he took us to the ruins

 you know
 I and I I knew then
 take you to a particular place
 Well
 they took us to this guy s studio
 He what
 Took us to this guy artist s studio
 Uh
 and
 Rae
 he was there
 And she saw a painting she liked
 And

 he wanted that damn recorder
 And he said I tell you what I ll do
 XX make you a deal
 He said I'll
 You take this painting
 I want that recorder
 Could
 It was
 It s about a thousand dollar swap
 Shit I thought my wife was gonna have a fit

 Mexico City was a
 in those days
 probably still is
 not
 For this guy he was very successful
 Uh
 very prolific
 But it was an art colony
 A lot of Americans down there
 because
 cost of living was so cheap at the time
 And they they had these art shows everywhere
 Well we bought a painting

 of a little Mexican woman
 still got it
 Think I paid VOX thirty dollars for it VOX
 Uh
 while I was down there
 we may have bought a couple of other i inexpensive paintings
 maybe collectively we bought
 maybe spent a hundred and fifty dollars
 Uh
 hell I was not an art
 And
 Uh
 The s first painting I ever bought
 Geri Rae
 it was one of Geri s original early early paintings
 While we were down there

 You know I
 This
 It
 You know I ve had that painting for thirty five years I guess
 And I really like it
 Uh
 my
 My my father in law wanted to give me a painting for my
 And so I had a
 We had a display guy at the time
 fashioned himself as an artist
 And I said Ben
 pick me out something
 You've got fifty bucks to spend
 So
 he got this from Geri
 and I loved it
 XX
 I can see all kinda things in it
 to make a long s
 This fellow LeRoy Neiman
 PAR over here PAR
 Sports artist
 Not the same guy
 as this guy Nierman
 Oh I thought there was a connection
 No
 Well
 we looked at a lot of art
 in the
 parks
 pleasant weather and
 Like that
 It was sorta like

 What the hell they call the district in New York
 put their paintings out

 You know all the all these artists put their
 must've had three areas like that
 And
 most of em
 very inexpensive

 Well

 we wandered around down in the
 in Mexico City where

 most of the jewelry shops are and things
 It s got a name
 They also had a lot of

 artist galleries down there
 And I walked into this gallery
 during one of our
 We were down there maybe ten days
 And I saw this guy Nierman
 at that time
 He he he got famous at the nineteen

 probably seventy two Olympics
 Uh
 but his c
 He also was very prolific
 Big handlebar mustache
 And I walked in
 and there must have been about
 twelve or fifteen paintings in there
 They were

 You walked into his studio
 It was a gallery
 Uh
 The oth th
 The guy n
 who was a Mexican national
 Forgotten his first name
 But any rate
 but
 this guy s name was LeRoy Neiman

 Uh
 These were paintings
 there
 Which is a seriograph
 And
 we went in
 and

 And he had about fifteen twenty paintings
 football players
 that s what he did
 they were about that size
 I d been in there

 They were you know very
 Had a very distinctive style
 And

 the guy said
 God you've been in here
 so many times that
 You pick out any four of these you want
 The four of em
 Shit
 I bought those fucking paintings

 I promise you as God is my witness
 This guy s originals sell for MRC a hundred thousand dollars apiece or more MRC
 You are kidding
 He is
 big

 And
 I d never heard of him
 And
 That was about
 That was about nineteen
 And I was watching the Olympics
 of nineteen seventy two
 And he d been engaged by the Olympic committee
 Uh he was prominent then
 but not world famous

 And
 I
 He was up all over
 He s got a great big bull of
 Bull Moose moustache sort of a deal
 And
 his art was so distinctive
 And he s
 I said Jesus
 I remember seeing at the Olympics
 I hollered and screamed
 Well of course
 since that time
 I'm on his mailing list
 XX XX
 that
 and they get today
 twenty five hundred to twenty seven fifty for a seriograph
 Of which he produces maybe three to five hundred of em
 Depending on the issue
 But these were originals
 I

 He was
 I could've walked away with those things and
 And
 I I I p

 That damn thing
 I didn t know
 if I d done I'd done that

 It was
 But still five hundred dollars was a lot of money in those
 Five hundred dol lars was

 for
 novelties and things of that nature
 you know it was
 Oh man it was
 We we we stayed in a first rate

 Who was of course an Ala bama football player

 Like it was like computers
 Well in a year or so after that
 Cause it was s
 heavy heavy heavy
 You
 and

 Sixty eight

 Just twenty seven twenty eight years ago
 I was thirty eight thirty nine years old
 And
 I
 I sure didn t have

 And
 to have gone out there and spent
 another fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars for artwork
 you know
 my mother
 come back
 if she d've known


 She d've deducted it

 Oh
 Any rate
 Ah it s true story
 It was a true story
 I I
 Well it would've cost you that to replace the doggone machine
 Aw I d've had to replace it for the store

 I guess a year
 those things were really antiquated
 Although we used em a lot
 and I
 you know I recorded the whole trip
 and
 It was a wonderful trip
 we had good times
 Uh
 We
 I keep a
 and man it was arduous
 I keep a diary

 when I
 go out of the country
 Still got em in here
 Otherwise
 my problem is
 and it s a lot easier to do it that way
 I keep I diary when I go out of the country

 with me
 not that it comes up too much
 but someone ll say something to me about somewhere I s
 Shit
 I I
 you know I
 I forgot where I went
 Well you go to so many places
 on a cruise particularly
 So many places in a short time

 until you make another trip
 you can remember

 They d o
 to separate the trip that you went on this one f
 It s tough to do
 And

 On a business trip
 I was there for fifteen days
 But it was
 went to
 Japan
 and then
 Taipei and Hong Kong
 Uh
 Um but it was for me

 not only an education
 but through
 a group
 And it was a group of us that went
 a dozen in our group that went
 There was a group of stores that we were associated with

 It s amazing ain't it
 you know y
 You know we ve talked about this
 on groups for years
 all the problems we got with the Blacks
 I believe it was the paper this morning
 Where I read it
 MRC Thirty three percent MRC
 of the Black juveniles in their twenties
 are either in jail

 on parole
 or just released
 Thirty three percent
 And then I
 I read in a nother art
 And that doesn t count how many got away
 Oh that s right
 But that s of the
 in their twenties
 I read an article
 within the last three or four months
 and I m
 MRC twelve percent of the Black male population MRC of the United States MRC is POUNDING in prison MRC
 Twelve per cent POUNDING
 Of the Black male population
 how many di
 probably that many more
 But the point I was gonna make is
 and there re always exceptions
 Uh not to take anything away from
 Percy Jones
 because I mean he's
 what his family had
 you know he s
 he s c he s he s
 come out of it

 a class situation

 On areas score

 the the there s a
 hadn t thought about it in many years
 how those Blacks
 had integrated into the ci society
