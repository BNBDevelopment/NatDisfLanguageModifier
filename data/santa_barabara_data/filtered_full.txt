 So you don't need to go borrow equipment from anybody
 to
 to do the feet
 Do the hooves
 Well
 something
 So
 Mae
 I'm gonna
 to do those
 cause y
 n you just
 it takes
 and I'm not as good
 as like somebody that would do it all the time
 You know
 I mean
 Oh
 I'm not

 I don't know how to say it
 most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the time
 and I'm not that good or
 and I'm not very strong
 Did they train you
 Did they train you that
 X
 yeah
 So you have your own equipment

 No
 Dad
 you know
 is I kinda had a b general idea
 of kinda how to do it
 or
 people come to our place
 and
 I don't know
 down there

 you have to
 you have to take this class
 And you can only take
 And
 if you wanna go on in it
 you n
 And I decided to go ahead and go on in it
 And the first part of it
 is like
 well we have lecture
 then we have lab
 And like
 we just go into the classroom
 In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work
 I mean
 it
 they go over
 the whole
 the whole part of the horse
 I mean
 all the skeleton part of it you know
 and
 and they go through every kinda ligament
 millions of ligaments
 and millions of tendons
 I mean
 and then
 and then
 and
 you know
 You know
 and then
 the bone in the hoof
 then all the wall
 you know
 he went over on how to trim it
 and where you
 and a horse has this little white line
 and you clean it out with the
 with the hoof knife
 and then there
 and then you can see this little white line
 and that's kinda where you go by
 to
 SM you know
 has that little white line right the re
 and that 's where you kinda SM
 kinda need a little guide
 And
 I am still scared to do it
 I mean
 By doing it
 And make em
 and they're just a little bit
 for f
 I mean they're just sore
 That's not bad
 And they m
 they have to
 keep em
 away from anything
 no hard pebbles
 or hard clods of dirt or anything
 So
 ( Hx) I don't know
 I'm a little scared about doing it yet
 When I get done with them
 SM A lot of times
 and I'll look at
 and it's still
 it's too long
 And then like
 I would never
 ever
 ever
 to shoe a horse
 See we did that too
 we did
 We did a lot of stuff
 we did a lot of stuff with the

 the burners
 and you'd put the
 you'd have
 you started out with the straight iron
 you know
 and you'd stick it into the
 into the
 you know like
 And you'd put it into the hot SM coals
 And then
 we'd
 and we'd make it a
 But

 We just put the shoes that were already made
 And that's as far as we got
 Well as a matter of fact
 this is really funny
 there isn't really any girl farriers around anywhere
 They're really
 th Yeah
 And the m
 the reason they were showing us this at college
 to get us
 to know if our trimmer
 and shoer were_s doing it right
 and
 plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments
 we had it in another class too
 we
 that was kind of a double thing that
 we had in
 in another class
 well it was a review for some people
 if it was a review or not
 But
 anyway

 PAR P what was I gonna say
 I forgot what I was think
 Well
 w um
 when we put em on a horse's hoof
 they're already made
 they're round
 we pick out a size
 you know we'd
 this is a double aught
 this is
 what s
 and double aught and aught
 are the ones that are most popular
 For
 you know
 the
 that's a d
 Or ponies
 But we're talking just the regular
 light horses you know
 And
 aught and aught
 aught
 Well anyway
 you go get your
 Okay
 And you go get your shoe
 It's already made
 _You go look
 every horse is gonna have a little different shape
 And so what you have to do
 So every
 every
 horseshoe is made
 No no
 No
 What
 then that's that's where the ferrier comes in
 Every shoe
 you get order
 You'd get
 The ferrier gets em
 You know
 And then
 _Our job
 to the horse's foot
 And that
 but it's really hard to do
 I mean
 some of em you have to
 you know
 say your shoe's like this
 and your horse's foot is just really wide or something
 Well then you have to put it on the anvil
 well then once you stretch the shoe out
 well then
 the two corners
 you know
 You stretch this out
 then you have to round these back
 you know
 It's just
 it s it sounds easy
 I would never do it
 I mean we had to do it
 it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod
 I mean
 that's
 thirty bucks
 for twenty horses
 I mean
 Jesus
 that would be a th nine hundred dollars
 SM I mean
 So
 w you know
 like
 that have a lot of horses and stuff
 and that they're riding a lot
 let the college kids do em
 For em you know
 They're taking the risk
 of having their horse get lame
 It really never happens
 And it's not like
 there's a person that's just gung ho
 trims their feet
 all the time I mean
 he e
 you know
 so it's
 But
 P PAR What was I gonna say PAR P
 Oh
 And it
 you get so
 I've only done like
 well
 at the end of the year
 And
 right now
 only shod about
 five horses
 Trimmed a lot of em
 And you know what we start out with
 What
 We start out
 with
 dead horse hooves
 I mean
 you know
 the the canneries
 The people that
 that
 kill the horses for meat and stuff
 You know they have all these legs and stuff
 And
 I don't know
 everybody
 I thought they used the the horsehooves in for gelatin
 HI You know
 then they
 they probably use em for everything
 But anyway
 we get these horse hooves
 they
 a long ways to go get em
 to get these horse hooves
 For the college
 They go back East
 So we have this frozen horse hoof
 cause you don't want to cripple up a really good horse
 that horse would have been
 lame
 like crazy
 But
 it was just
 sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit
 they start really stinking and stuff
 HI I mean
 you have this HI piece of horse
 HI I mean this leg that's HI
 And like in some of em
 blood will spurt out
 It's nothing
 SM it's the grossest thing SM
 And that's why
 that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory
 it's just the
 But once you get into it
 But
 I would have never got into that class
 if
 there's no way
 I heard everybody saying
 talking about
 VOX Oh
 and they stink VOX
 I'm never
 And then once I got into it
 But
 at first it was kind of a bummer
 But
 I'm glad I took it
 Really glad
 It pays off
 twelve bucks
 I mean that's twelve bucks
 You know
 with
 a horse that I was really using a lot
 that's still twelve dollars
 shoot
 But
 anybody
 I always have somebody that really knows what they're doing
 But anyway
 I wanna wait until the morning
 to do that
 because
 It's just
 too hot in the afternoon
 I mean you can get
 just
 exhausted
 Anyway
 I was gonna tell you about that
 the girl
 there isn't mary very many
 ferrier girls you know
 This summer I met one
 Jorgensen's
 they have one shoer
 And I guess like in Minnesota it's real wet
 and stuff you know
 they really have to watch their shoes
 It's like
 and they're not as dry or anything
 When you get back here
 we have to watch out for like
 like the hooves being too dry
 The
 Not this time of the year
 you know
 usually they're too wet
 and that
 that shoe can just pull right off
 the hoof wall is so soft
 Yeah
 you know
 and I nei
 I didn't realize that in
 you know
 Sure it's gonna be softer
 But I never even thought about that until I took this class
 So it's
 you know that's kinda stuff too that you think about
 But anyway
 they always have this one horseshoer
 this girl's been in this ferrier

 she's going to an actual ferrier college
 They have a lot of those around
 a lot
 And she's going to one of em
 like nine months
 to this one
 Where is the

 left to go
 What
 Guess I'll put it on

 she
 he's like taking her as a
 you know
 And
 it's really different
 you just don't see that
 at all
 ever
 Jorgensen's have a girl
 or a g
 you know a guy
 And they
 are
 there's this girl
 Yeah
 I couldn't believe it
 She's a tiny girl
 she's got arms the size of
 they're huge
 but she must only
 HI What is m blowing out of there HI
 it's just
 it gets dust accumulated in it
 It was just on last night
 I
 It Mae Lynne
 for one thing the filters are dirty because it it so
 been so dry
 And the
 it all comes acrost
 the road
 you know
 and
 and then it builds up real bad with
 deposits
 In other words I should be change filters
 God
 I know
 It won't last long
 But
 it sure does make a mess in the house
 I need new filters
 Anyway
 I mean
 She's out there just
 working away
 And
 trim and trim and trim
 And shoe
 for me
 that's something I'm not used to
 you just
 HI it's HI tiring
 The very
 at the very beginning
 Then we moved up to two
 Then we moved up to a full horse
 And
 We were just slowly got in shape
 But now if I went to do that
 I'd never be able to handle it
 It's just
 it's a
 It is really hard work
 You're bent over
 and it's
 you know
 it takes like
 I don't know why you sweat so bad doing it either
 it's just hard hard work
 It's
 it doesn't seem like it would be
 it is
 Those
 It's hard
 You don't get kicked a lot
 I've never been kicked
 But like
 most people's horse
 And they
 they don't get by with stuff
 you know
 horses at college
 it's like a kid
 are ornery
 And like
 kinda be ornery about half way
 but not not too bad
 I've never been kicked doing it at all
 And that's another thing we had to learn in the class you know
 just had to learn our safety of
 where to stand
 You have to stand like these certain ways
 oh and it's a killer on your back
 You're standing


 You're standing like this you know
 And like
 the horse's hoof _lays like this right over you
 like this working
 This is like a hoof knife
 then a
 And like in the front
 You stick the horse's hoof between your leg
 Kinda like that
 It's really hard on your back
 Like
 I noticed that girl's back muscles were just tremendous
 Couldn't believe it
 She had like on this really p kinda short shirt

 There's this
 I think that's cold
 Just don't
 it's
 it's just
 Makes a sound
 Nkay
 So what
 what were you gonna do out there today
 What other
 what other things were you gonna
 Just go out and
 Look at the filly
 Yeah
 I think more or less
 so late now
 Pretty much all we're gonna do is go out
 I don't know what her plans really are
 But I think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then
 maybe go to that seasonal dance
 Is that what it's called
 I don't know
 I don't know what it's called either
 You know
 Doing what
 The dance
 How he said there's four guys
 Since there's four seasons
 He's a pretty neat guy
 I thought
 Yeah
 he spoke Crow okay


 I got a kick out of him when he kept saying it
 See this little cat
 Little cat
 I know
 that sounds like kit
 I don't wanna say kitten


 So she named everybody in the class except for
 About four people
 I think they asked for names
 Oh did they
 Hunh
 That's funny
 Look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there
 Yeah
 I noticed on the
 on the case for the tape recorder too
 that it's all
 Look right here
 Just
 That's
 It's like ash
 Is it from
 that must be from the fires
 You know
 Maybe it is
 Uh
 Cause that one whole day
 from
 but look at your cigarettes
 Just sitting there
 On the way into r
 from Roundup
 yesterday morning
 And they were
 talking about the weather and they said
 how we
 In Roundup
 On the way from Roundup
 I was listening to the radio
 Yesterday morning
 And they were talking
 Unhunh
 Is that right
 And I guess just from the fires

 Uh
 day before yesterday
 It was
 the wind was blowing real hot when I first got up
 And it was early
 Real early
 that
 that wind was just hot
 And
 well the smoke all blew in
 And it was just dense
 Okay then
 it
 that
 s
 it just kinda blew the smoke in
 then it was real hazy
 you'd look at the sun
 It was just
 She said people were driving around with their lights on
 And the lights were
 they didn't look like they were
 it's just from the drought and the dust
 you know
 and the smoke in the air
 I've never seen anything like it
 And she said like
 the lights looked a greenish color
 Yeah
 It was a weird
 ugly
 ugly day
 Rana Lee's gonna have a baby by the way
 Brian's wife
 I didn't even know she was pregnant
 Of course I guess they can get big in three months
 Well
 I I told you
 Bran
 F what's her name
 Rana Lee
 Rana Lee F
 Unhunh
 Rana Lee

 I don't know why I told you that
 SING Rana Lee SING
 She had a brother that died from asthma too
 Seem like a lot of people
 I mean that's weird
 Why don't we go
 just in
 except
 Just in a matter of a year's time
 Really
 Yeah
 Her brother was like
 just right out of high school
 I mean
 about Deb at all
 She probably really couldn't
 You know
 she was
 she was in and out of the hospital
 Who was that
 Debby
 I mean she was in

 she loved horses so much
 XXXX stuff on it
 and she was always
 she's allergic to horsehair
 Oh

 Well XX
 Did she ever go to a allergy doctor
 or anybody like that
 She t
 well they
 they should have gotten her
 I don't know why they didn't either
 I
 I w always wondered about that
 and she was s
 she had such severe asthma
 I would have done a little bit more for her I think
 If you wanna talk about somebody tired
 that girl couldn't walk down to the street and back
 And me and mom always accused her of being lazy
 You know
 HI all she did was sleep HI
 She sounded like she had more problems than
 she probably wasn't really lazy
 you know
 we like take everything for granted
 Then somebody like that
 every little breath is like and effort to em
 d

 Well Deb by got
 Debby got to the point
 you know every
 just
 really often she would go
 and her
 was just hard
 labored breathing all of her life
 She actually died of a heart attack
 They did have an autopsy done on her
 It surprised me
 But they
 And it was actually a
 Mhm
 One side of her heart was just hard
 the muscle
 from just labored breathing
 trying to breathe all the time
 That's just sick
 Yeah
 we didn't realize what she was going through
 And you know
 maybe that's another reason why she didn't really
 maybe mom she kinda knew about all this stuff
 pay that much attention to Amanda
 I mean it seems like she'd pay more attention to her
 last forever for her
 I mean
 well if I go
 You know
 just little things
 Yeah
 It's just too bad
 I just hope Orville and Genetta get that little girl
 there's no
 They can't
 They want her three months out of the year
 You know
 there's not much they can do
 Oh she was divorced
 Mhm
 Yeah
 This is the type of person
 that is like a hermit
 I don't know what you'd call him

 Well they were rai raised backward
 He's like
 Uh
 back woods
 Back woodsy
 didn't d
 Never came down out of the mountains
 He doesn't have any
 He doesn't know what's going on in this world
 No he doesn't
 He was just not properly brought up
 He
 Um
 I forget
 Idaho
 Um Macley
 Arco
 Isn't that where Deb kinda was
 But he's just really really really strange
 I can't imagine teaching a

 Who suggested this to em
 It was probably my sister in law's idea because
 I think they saw that movie
 Tap
 X
 They had
 the movie with that really hot tap danc er
 He was actually here two weeks ago
 at the at the jazz t ap thing or whatever
 No he's like
 Yeah he's a teenager
 That boy
 he's supposed to be awe some
 Really fa st
 But I'm sure that was the the impetus
 No
 You you probably read the same Examiner article I read

 he's teaching these classes
 And
 he k
 He does n't explain anything precisely
 before they can g pick it up

 Prob ably XX XXX
 I mean he has a bro
 Yeah
 I guess that he was being hauled around in a little wagon and stuff
 He healed very quickly
 Guess kids' bones
 just like grow back really fast
 Th that's it
 little kids usually don't break their legs anyway
 Cause they're so XXX
 you know
 aren't their k legs pretty soft
 there's less calcium deposits in them
 And also
 they're still growing
 And the way bones grow is
 you make cartilage
 and then you deposit calcium in it
 So that's why they always have more flexibility
 you're making cartilage
 So it al
 in which case
 They get old and cranky like the rest of us


 Old and rickety and brittle
 Mhm
 uncoordinated and unflexible
 Right
 Stiff
 That too
 What are you planning on doing with dancing
 You were taking some classes last fall
 I'll take a few more
 as a

 Hm
 That's why you married her











 No
 But he's my

 he's my friend



 I stuck up for you today at that store
 You did

 the green scarf
 That's right
 He was my fashion consultant today


 I wasn't
 That's right
 Well you
 I don't know
 We were at this dumb store
 and the clerk kept trying to keep us interested
 while she was buying

 Don't you wanna try on the men's clothes

 Well I

 and they look really good in them
 Then they didn't buy em
 Right
 Well
 You know how boys are
 They never buy clothes

 Students are are broke


 Or is that a real

 You know these boxes




 XXX
 Cause I feel like I'm hearing
 We have
 These are the shittiest speakers on earth
 besides the ones in the kitchen
 You think we have like a jazz band next door

 is there somebody downstairs
 playing

 I mean that was what I first thought
 It's our garage band
 when when the jazz came on
 As compared to the other stuff
 or kind of coming in from some place
 Usually we just have really loud salsa parties across the street
 And teenagers
 kissing each other on the side walk
 And little kids throwing paint in your backyard



 right in the front
 But
 Well I k
 Oh rude
 So I thought oh shit
 so I I got
 This whole tube of it across the street
 Those kids are just
 So I threw it away
 There gonna have another
 brat kid
 The the the really fat red haired woman
 The VOX get over here you
 Does she have a what

 She has some kind of a
 Yeah
 At one time


 And they were banging their their soccer ball up against our
 below the bedroom th the study window
 I opened
 VOX Ah
 I felt like such an old lady

 Eight hundred

 and one who's like twelve
 who has friends
 and then there's the middle cow

 The butterball
 The butter ball


 The butterball
 r
 he'd be running around
 d in the street with his diapers on
 this butterball of a kid

 once he stopped running
 that whenever he runs
 And he's
 you know
 a year and a half yea years old
 A year and a half years old



 They're terrible
 Really
 I can't t
 How do you
 It's not eating too much
 I mean thi this thi this just happened
 in the middle of the night
 Well it's no worse than her screaming at em
 Yeah but now you'll have both
 Yeah right
 Probably be like
 I feel
 But I
 kay


 Those two top masks
 there
 Yep




 Uh oh
 i
 Well you see their eyeballs
 Yeah the other
 But the thing is
 Do you know those
 any of those dances
 The little what
 Looks like
 the second
 Why
 one from the top looks like a guy who was in the Oba Oba k skit
 What's an Oba Oba skit
 I never saw that
 Look like
 a real


 That's pretty good
 Just like him

 With the right
 This isn't from Africa
 No
 From Indonesia
 But that person looks Black
 Which one is it
 The
 The
 I figure the second one from the to p
 Hunh
 That's interesting

 cause I think Indo Indonesians
 think
 people who've been to Indonesia
 think that those guys
 have really European characteristics
 compared to Indonesians
 Just cause their eyes are real big and their noses are big
 Oh really
 and flat noses and stuff
 P I don't know P
 Except those
 well
 I don't know
 the
 the bottom ones don't have flat noses either
 That's true they all have b
 But they get bigger as you go up anyway
 Their mustaches
 Is it the
 the way their little beard goes

 I d
 He looks like that guy
 Poor guy
 That is really interesting



 Cause I remember
 's kinda funny
 Well the top guy has a real thick lip
 Oh in his black leather jacket and his black
 hood hat


 He didn't

 Then he tried to
 He danced with a friend of mine
 Yeah
 I said
 boy
 Oo
 Oo
 Oba Oba

 Mm
 But I'm sure those guys get a lot of attention from women
 I'm sure a lot of women throw themselves at em
 A lot of groupies
 Yeah
 Fringe benefits

 The only fringe benefit of being a dancer
 Well in San Francisco
 you never know if it's a benefit or not


 I didn't know this
 but apparently in Brazil
 probably
 It's supposed to be very high
 You mean like
 higher than the United State
 Higher than around here
 Hm
 P I wouldn't be surprised P

 it's something like forty percent of males
 in the Bay Area
 this is what
 this doesn't seem like it can be true
 ninety per cent of gay men
 are HIV positive
 and fifty percent of all males
 are HIV positive
 Fifty perc
 It was some
 Like
 a m
 and it was fairly young men
 but
 It wasn't necessarily that they were infected
 Well
 it's the same difference
 Mhm
 sooner or later you'll come down with the actual disease
 But that's what she said
 Now I don't know if she meant the Bay area or San Francisco

 but those are some ferocious numbers
 if one out of
 That's just horrible
 two guys
 you meet
 yeah

 cause there're a lot of women out there who apparently don't believe in using condoms
 Hm
 I'm just amazed
 in t's mainly urban areas
 that had this really disproportionately high propor

 percentage
 r rural areas
 had like ten percent or less
 of the males
 had been infected
 Well I would assume San Francisco is higher than most cities around the country
 that just blew me away
 Cause I'm thinking well gee
 Yeah
 Well
 and just talking with guys
 in their twenties
 I mean these guys
 say these women don't care if they use rubbers or not

 you know
 with all the information available
 Right yeah
 That's really scary
 So I guess it's time for me to become a priest

 Oh
 This woman I knew I was gonna ask out
 BR God BR

 was telling me how her sister just won't use rubbers
 HI at all HI
 Well where would she put them

 I mean
 what are they thinking
 P I don't know P
 Don't look at me
 I I was just really amazed to hear that
 We don't have sex
 you would know better
 And in high school
 Mhm
 So
 Something's wrong
 I thought we got our electricity fixed

 though
 It's been doing
 didn't I
 Oh
 But
 What what
 Who is this
 I don't know
 it's from the radio station years ago when I was in Santa Cruz
 You know on Sundays
 at ten o'clock
 That's right now
 what is that
 oh I don't know what the radio station is
 they played this

 I don't know what it was
 But it was like I went to Bahia
 What's
 last Sunday
 got there at eight
 left a ten
 dropped this person off at home
 and I was noticing
 the songs they were playing on the radio
 Hm
 should I turn on the radio statio
 I I was
 P KKSF
 does that mean anything to you P
 Nope
 You have to translate it to a number

 But
 I was just remembering being surprised
 I didn't realize
 I don't know anything about Brazilian music
 You go to the Brazilian club
 and they're singing songs
 apparently I guess that's the popular stuff
 I guess
 I'm so used to hearing those songs
 I didn't think anything of it
 this guy played songs for a whole hour
 eighty per cent of those songs I'd
 that band had sung that very night
 Mhm

 Pickup band's pretty good there
 Vi va
 Oh

 Friday night
 Oh
 The dance floor's too small in that place though
 It's really annoying
 P I like this song P
 Are they teaching any more lambada
 at
 school
 Yeah
 Vivian was giving a lambada lesson
 Cause
 when I was there the other day
 Really
 XX
 So I can learn how to beat my hips
 cause their their hips are SLAPPING beating up against you
 you know

 Hundred cycles per second


 It


 And the
 only way to learn how is to dance with them mo re
 But
 No th
 I don't
 I don't
 They haven't done anything recently
 I
 like
 May and June
 and
 Is she a good lambada dancer
 I can't imagine her being a
 Yeah but
 I didn't feel like she taught it any different
 significantly differently than when Vivian and Jeff taught it
 I mean
 cause they do it
 and real simple
 different
 than Brazilians do it
 I mean
 I don't know what those Brazilian women are doing
 What are they do ing
 Are they going
 really fast
 I mean are they going one two three
 and then
 it's like
 SLAPPING they're coming
 I mean
 I don't even know how you can do that
 You're dancing with them
 SLAPPING


 using their pelvic bones
 Yeah
 You know

 but anyway

 But that's what I want to learn
 Don't
 don't they teach you to go
 one two three
 Or do they go like really fast like that
 It was just Jeff and
 sure
 but that's cause it's for s
 Right
 you know
 it seems to me if they're gonna teach it like what you do

 Or what they teach
 You know
 I mean
 hm
 do it like that
 I should
 I like that
 P P
 I mean after I f
 I mean I
 Are you
 night
 In fact I would have gone today

 Well I finally found some people there I can dance with
 So that helps
 To go there
 Yeah
 No
 Besides

 If
 If you're a woman
 I swear it



 You could come too
 Well I don't necessarily mean
 in a bad way
 I'm not dancing with guys
 All I can say is
 Da rn
 Oo
 But





 it's kind of funny
 So she's just gonna watch
 every once in a while I'd get up and dance
 and it's like
 when I'd come back


 I mean I don't know if they
 Maybe Harold you should come with me
 Why
 So I can find
 learn some lam lambada

 find some girls with empty chairs next to em



 Maybe I should go with Miles
 Oh did

 did
 What
 told you that story about that woman
 who
 I was there Sunday three four weeks ago
 Uh
 after the class is over w
 over with
 I'm sitting down at a table
 there's a woman from
 who was in the class
 sitting to my right
 is a table with two women there
 They had apparently just come from Oba Oba
 on the last night
 P Oh I think you told me
 And like
 well they were attractive women
 Anyway
 out there dancing
 BR by himself BR
 And the woman was just looking at him
 in front of him
 in this skirt that's this short
 takes her hands
 and goes along his toes
 and is just doing like that
 I figured
 Oo
 very well
 in fact
 Gross
 And
 they did that for the whole dance
 people would like cheering
 Q go for it Q
 And all this kind of HI thing HI
 The the song ended
 the guy set down
 at another table
 And she set down
 at a
 This is like




 this woman's sitting about as far away from me as Jamie is
 And I was thinking
 I wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her
 No sooner did I think this thought

 What
 you didn't ask her to dance
 Not Miles
 he's just in daze

 why wasn't he sitting at her table
 You mean
 you were still thinking about it


 this guy

 I mean he comes over there
 immediately afterwards
 the same guy who got his
 the same guy who's
 who was like sitting about where you are
 Yeah
 He was sitting there
 And then these two women are sitting here
 So
 I don't know about what
 she and her friend are over at their table
 And then
 twenty minutes later
 they were kinda like all over each other
 kissing
 And I was thinking
 these people aren't going home alone tonight

 Go sh
 But I just thought that
 Oh my God
 Well
 maybe I shouldn't go there then
 Yeah
 maybe you shouldn't
 No
 I went there before
 it was really fun
 I went out there before
 Oh
 Without telling me
 You knew
 If I was going out dancing
 Oh
 I did
 every now and then
 Well the thing that gets me
 I meet this
 I meet this psychotherapist
 who tells me she's addicted to this dance
 which I th
 think is a interesting choice of words for a psychotherapist to use
 But
 she's married
 and apparently she's there without her husband
 She has her wedding ring on
 And it's like she's with this guy
 and they're kinda like all over each other
 And I'm thinking
 I guess that's her husband
 Uh oh did you say something
 but I

 but the thing is
 you know she's kind of all sophisticated and everything
 this guy
 I can't really believe that guy's her husband
 And of course later on I find out
 that's not her husband
 HI So
 you know HI

 But

 bizarre
 But then she tells me
 gee I don't know what it is about this guy I mean
 I've been trying to tell him I don't want a sexual relationship with him
 from the way they look

 you don't do that with
 So
 To other people I mean

 Well

 I mean maybe
 That was actually very profound
 Yeah
 that was

 You
 something'll land in your mouth



 He must have been
 HI that must have been quite a shock HI
 That sounds really weird
 you're
 some twenty year old woman comes up doing that to you


 I think you think
 Apparently

 I'll f I'll tell you when I'm fifty what you think



 Mhm
 What
 That'll be weird when you're fifty
 Wonder what you'll look like
 Nobody's fifty

 Oh well
 ten o'clock
 Look like it's bedtime for some folks here
 Yep
 Yep
 Well that was good ice cream
 Bud's
 Pralines and cream
 Uh
 Praline

 I know
 It's kind of smelly
 WHISTLE
 Well let's see

 Instead of

 Good good
 Okay
 How much
 Do you guys each want like
 half of that

 With the leftovers

 This is a big fucking fish
 Roy
 What what what
 do you want half
 half of one of these
 I could eat one of those
 You could
 Hm

 Then I guess
 well don't
 Then I'll
 Y
 cook all the fish
 Cause
 well
 if you don't cook it
 Now

 So you can eat about that much Peter

 But I
 I'm
 I'm also capable of eating lots of stuff

 the fridge SING
 XX microwave

 VOX Oh God VOX

 Do you have a salad spinner

 They're cool
 Is this like something you had when you were young
 No
 It's brand new
 I don't think they ever

 Hey bud
 FOOD
 Yeah FOOD
 They weren't crawling with disgusting pesticides
 Conceptual pesticides
 P Whatever P
 Pesticides of the mind

 FOOD Could I FOOD beg your indulgence
 my dear
 That I might slip in past you here
 You can
 VOX Sure VOX

 Well actually I have Trader Joe's
 VOX whipped garlic bread spread VOX
 Oh boy

 Right

 I know
 Q well
 we could've gone out
 I wanted it to be home made Q


 Q fla vors of the evening
 Now it will be the spray on




 Is it really
 Uh
 yes
 It's
 it's really icky
 But
 I'm gonna cut this up
 so I can fry it
 S
 How come like
 the bread crumbs weren't already attached to the fish



 Well I probably could've bought it that way

 But I
 you know
 I said
 Well at least they are like already breaded
 I mean crumbed and in the jar
 they're working on breed ing pre breaded red snapper


 Have you heard about these horrific new genetic developments
 in in food livestock
 Y_no
 Like what
 they're trying to breed
 VOX ho ho VOX
 they're trying to breed like a forty foot long tube chicken
 F VOX No VOX F
 You mean so that they can go right from that to Chicken McNuggets
 They're like
 they're like
 Yeah
 and it has

 it has n
 basically no body bones except a spine
 WH Yuck WH
 to con vey the nerves
 VOX Oh no VOX
 this is like some kind of horrific nightmare
 This
 That is the worst
 I
 And it's just awful
 Course
 You know
 the early man probably said the same thing about the first domestic chicken

 you know
 VOX Can you imagine
 FOOD Right FOOD
 Oh
 I wonder if it's this horrible
 Is there something fishy that smells
 No
 No

 fish smell from the potent red snapper
 Well
 it'll be unpotent in a minute
 Not to worry
 Let me see
 What was I in here for
 there's nothing worse than staring like a dope at your own refrigerator
 Um
 oh an egg
 God damn it
 You son of a bitch


 I thought it was funny
 Hilarious
 I'm laughing

 I got quite a giggle out of it

 Um
 Um
 did you dispense with the tomatoes that I had sitting in here
 In a fit of household efficiency

 okay
 One egg will do
 So my mom didn't catch any fish
 Mhm
 Up north she said
 Rotten luck
 Like in lakes
 Um

 on the coast of Or egon
 Oh my
 Oops
 Too late
 They have some
 So like what are they catching
 Unh hunh
 And some guy who
 who knows a good thing when he's on to it
 calls them up
 I see
 And says
 VOX oh
 The fish are running
 and blah blah blah b VOX
 Catch fabulous salmon
 And they have it canned
 You know
 when they're up there
 and I guess they have some frozen
 VOX put it in our stockings
 Aw
 Isn't that great
 It's nice for them
 But no salmon in your stockings this year
 Spend their va
 they have already done it
 So
 I mean
 this was
 another trip
 they were supposed to go up in
 more
 you know
 environmental thing
 They were supposed to go up at the end of August
 When they usually run
 VOX fish weren't running this year VOX
 Nothing's doing what it's supposed to
 anymore
 anywhere
 That's why that whole mountain climbing expedition was screwy
 What mountain climbing expedition was that
 XX
 The one that we were part of
 The ex pedition we went on in Nepal
 Um
 Supposed to be perfect weather
 right in between the
 And they ended up getting early winter storms
 Yeah
 Mhm
 Everywhere we've been
 in the past several years
 everybody's talking about how
 the weather just isn't normal
 That's definitely been the case in Indonesia
 Really
 Yeah
 Well like
 when I was living there for the couple of years
 it was
 the rainy season was all off
 you know
 and was dry during the rainy season
 Gee
 They were having a drought while I was there
 Yeah
 I mean
 I I don't know if our drought here will ever break
 This is it
 Hm
 Well they
 they claim that there's these cycles
 and that we're in the the middle of a normal cycle
 I don't know how true that is
 Well
 Thanks
 I r I really
 We read this great book
 Called
 The End of Nature
 Ew
 Sounds wonderful
 this

 you know
 Harvard guy
 a la Thor eau
 anyway
 And
 it's called
 yeah
 and it's just really a scary book
 There's no natural world left
 Right
 His premise is basic ally this
 That

 as soon as the world hit a point
 where there was no more objectively pristine land
 Unhunh
 When
 they found pollution on top of Mount Everest
 and at the very bottom of the ocean
 Right
 FOOD Well
 Mhm
 Man has had some effect
 On the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe
 Right
 So in principle
 the concept of nature
 is over
 Right
 And then
 in practice
 since then
 mhm
 MRC man has had such MRC dramatic impact
 on what we used to think of as nature
 that

 that the only way to coexist with nature
 nature
 the quasi religious
 overarching
 in side of which mankind lives
 and
 w a a thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force
 over and above ourselves
 to order the universe
 you know

 Which just doesn't sound like a very practical proposal
 Wow
 You know
 the same people brought you the extinction of all the large mammals in Europe and America

 And the dodo
 main taining what's there
 for the rest of time
 Not likely
 Mhm
 So
 that was his basic premise
 Then it gets really depressing

 new age

 of
 of how it might not be that way
 FOOD You know
 so
 forget it
 forget it
 forget it
 We're fucked FOOD
 Mhm
 Well I read it in the New Yorker
 yuck Q
 Right
 And I
 It was really
 I read the whole thing
 which is pretty rare
 Well my my
 So I mean
 but his premise is not that mankind can't survive on Earth
 Right
 His ques tion is
 It's just it's a whole different earth
 in a metaphysical world
 that man is the highest active principle
 Mhm
 You know
 Outside of
 completely faith based belief in God
 you know
 irrespective of any relationship to nature
 Mhm
 there is now
 in the world
 to which we are beholden
 And he w
 on the
 Sort of fucks up the animists
 cultural growth

 of
 Do we even want this
 Unhunh
 Well he is kind of saying its too late
 He's saying
 and we haven't even thought about
 Right
 This is typical
 Yeah
 You know
 And
 and then it gets down to s
 you know
 the
 w it's all fine and good for us in this ge neration
 Let's cook those XX
 Did
 Wash them
 did you want them broken smaller
 Alright
 Yeah
 VOX Yeah VOX
 or saving the polar bea r
 Pandas
 mhm
 But
 implicit is
 anytime in the future
 that man the collective
 you know
 group
 Mhm
 individual special interests decide
 Right
 They're out of there
 Bango
 And
 so anyway
 interesting book
 I read it because of this project
 Which project
 The ani mal kingdom project
 Oh okay
 I don't think I know about that project
 So is that why you went to Africa
 Yeah
 Such a scum bag
 He's going back to
 so he
 Nepal
 And
 India too
 when
 November
 P Make me P
 No
 They aren't
 They
 FOOD Oh
 That's why
 I have a neat book
 I don't know if you've seen
 What's Cebuano
 It's in the Philippines too
 It's on the island of Cebu
 Oh
 Of course
 Figure that one out FOOD
 VOX No
 It's a department store in Tokyo

 a book called
 Power and Gold
 Power and Gold
 Power and Gold
 It's all about
 Moslems
 unhunh
 of the archipelago
 Oh that sounds great
 Oh it was like this
 The
 An
 it was neat
 Did you
 you
 Did you
 Oh no
 No
 Cause there's
 In the National
 in the National Museum they have a Gold Room
 That has all this gold stuff
 not made out of gold
 just
 Oh
 I mean
 it's this
 Or do you like
 Should they go somewhere
 where they they recycle
 turn in to compost
 we don't have a com post pile yet
 That's part of my
 Which is where
 landscape thing
 Garbage is underneath
 If you can save the bag
 you can turn it inside out and save it
 but
 you don't have to
 this is
 I'll put these on the dining room table
 XXX
 just
 Oh
 Anyway
 Mm
 Hey that carrot's good
 It's got
 it's really pretty
 it goes island to
 Should I start food
 Oh yeah
 Um
 they go in
 how about that
 That looks good
 Alright
 L Art of the Archipelago L
 I think that's what it's called
 Which has Indonesian and Philippine architecture in it
 I don't know if you've seen either of those
 No
 These p
 He
 at least art histor ical parall els
 Should steam these
 peop le of A sam
 Unhunh
 Uh
 with
 with
 mostly Batak and Dayak and
 stuff
 you can imagine
 pretty clearly
 Unhunh
 Anyway
 interesting
 That looks like enough salad
 Oh I get it
 Mar went out to put the
 You put the water on the plants
 Is that what was going on
 What
 You were watering with that
 Yeah
 Yeah
 that's good
 actually
 Mhm
 but
 It's illegal
 Really
 How rude
 Isn't that retarded
 It is
 They just built a a great big gray water processing center
 at the laundromat
 in the complex where I live
 Oh
 There's all these huge machines and stuff
 Great m
 that like filter it and all
 and then it
 They're going to like
 pump it into their watering system
 for the apartment complex
 I mean you get your own
 You don
 It's not like a big system some where
 Yeah
 But this is like
 but it's a complex
 Right
 Cause
 this is this apartment complex
 and there's the laundromat
 and they just dump the water
 from that and everything
 FOOD Well laundry's the best way
 I guess FOOD
 The best way
 To get gray water
 think what might go down in the sink and stuff
 You wouldn't want to what
 Well
 I guess
 I guess it's more
 that
 It's not that you don't want it on your lawn
 Before it goes on your lawn
 Right
 Stuff from the sink
 Yeah
 Cause the stuff from the sink
 would be great for your lawn
 Yeah
 sort of decomposing
 instead of in a nice little compost pile
 Mm
 I mean
 you know
 if you
 if you
 if you didn't have
 if you were really careful about your dishes
 and it was just runoff
 Well that would be good
 Cause all of that stuff should go into the compost pile to begin with
 But
 Yeah
 Actually
 Zeke the sheik is a local
 You know
 Oh no I don't know a bout this
 It
 it caught fi
 It caught fire
 and

 he
 he used the compost from the

 place next door
 that was a big big big cemetery
 And
 here
 A huge ceme tery
 he would take the grass clippings
 So he had this
 M hm
 Or however long the butter lasts
 Um
 So he had
 you know
 internally
 Right
 just sort of naturally
 Mhm
 Yeah
 Ah
 Now what am I doing with this
 So just like this
 Butter them
 It's al ready open
 Okay
 Yeah and split em
 VOX You didn't even split em VOX

 Is L remanar L a verb

 at the private school in town
 they
 took us a while to get our kids Jolly Ranchers

 These kids are so
 I mean
 in them
 th
 Yeah
 because these are
 These are parents that have come from place s like El Salvador
 and they have ne ver learned English
 They look at you and they
 I'm just waiting for my kid to grow up so that he can work construction with me

 X

 They're in fourth grade
 They do shit like i
 They
 you know
 And they would
 I have couple parents
 who still
 call the L oficina L
 can't have free lunch
 Like for my first week there
 I gave it all to the kids
 all week long
 and
 and fill out the stupid form
 you know
 That takes two weeks to process

 Yeah
 how do you explain that to th
 They have a form in Spanish also
 Well

 I've
 cause I've received notes back
 You know
 Q Dear and esteemed teacher Q

 in m
 My child
 has already filled out this form

 There was one si tuation
 She's sleeping
 that doesn't
 speak a word of English
 good morning
 can I go to the bathroom
 can I go to the
 er
 and
 the office
 And she
 like
 you know



 yes you can

 L hello L




 That's what she does
 and she just giggles like a goofball

 She she does
 if
 if her skin weren't like really dark brown

 it's very unusual
 But
 her mom
 like
 it was a horrible situation
 stupid n
 n You know
 just in order to get my position secured there with the bureaucracy
 And there was a sub
 all filled out
 and that the s ub took it

 Oh for goodness sake
 you know
 I kept bugging Annalisa
 and I search my desk
 and they keep calling me on the
 their stupid in tercom system that you can hardly understand X
 You have to tell students
 never get give a tutor anything
 anything
 ever
 Not even homework
 They wouldn't let us give homework to the high school tut ors
 I know

 Yeah
 Well
 They
 They don't give a shit about anything
 I know

 I I I hadn't thought of that at th at that point last week
 Un less they've just begun subbing

 Q What are we gonna learn today

 See I'm originally a PE teacher



 they come in with that attitude
 Q I've always wanted to teach math

 Now
 what are we on Q
 VOX It's gonna be great VOX
 You know




 Q the what Q

 Q
 Why don't we go out and run some laps Q

 they

 distorted
 They don't know what they're do ing
 this lady is apparently
 Ah
 So whether the paper got in or not
 but
 You can't go and ask her

 Well I k kept calling the office
 and saying do you have this form

 Where is it
 she most of the time doesn't have money
 do you
 Can
 Do you have a form for her
 They don't have extra lunch es left over at the end of the day that they will give away
 w
 no
 You gotta go in and talk to the principal about this
 Coop
 this is a raging bureaucracy
 and there's nothing that I can do
 I have found that out
 When you wait until you hear what th all they've done with my class


 and so I go in there and I'm like
 well can you tell me whether the
 the form is on file
 cause I I n
 And the woman's like Q I can't do that

 THUMP li ke


 Because you can't access
 you know
 her form

 They're just giving
 Well they really are picking on the fact that I'm new
 y



 That I
 I would go further than that
 An d

 the teachers
 can't
 First they're like
 first I only had fifteen kids
 And the
 legally you have to have eighteen
 HISD rules has it that you have to have at least eighteen
 So I'm the only permanent sub
 who just started teaching
 Well Chris is the least experienced besides me
 he's had his certification
 he's real good at it
 So
 first they tell me
 doesn't even tell me
 the Friday before school starts
 And expects me to get my room ready
 and then
 and then I find out on Thursday
 Yeah you told me
 and
 and then
 th so I come into class
 and they've put like
 all these third grade students in there
 No
 It's really annoying
 to meet the l
 the
 They split it third and fourth
 little
 technicality that they have to meet
 They just s plit the whole thing
 Yeah
 it's
 well
 It's not for me
 You know
 Because
 you know
 and then
 You have to n
 and then
 That's what I was doing when I was student teaching
 Well they didn't even give me any texts
 I mean I was the only teacher
 Mhm
 So then on the
 You know
 And all these teachers are coming in and saying

 that they pick
 what the teachers do
 this kid is bad behaved
 I mean he's
 I'll just send him over to the new instructor
 So they s
 So the se are
 are the three third graders
 of the lowest e ducation
 and the worst conduct
 Right
 And so th

 CAROLYN Sorry

 Sharon standing in front of the class going

 L sen orita Flinn L


 I put up a list of rules
 And all day lo ng

 I went back to the rules
 VOX Do not pull on my clothes VOX


 and I'd point to number two


 Don't get out of your seat without permission

 So they'd look at me and they'd go





 The people w

 Th th ey k
 they'd be talking the whole time


 you know

 And I finally got to where I withheld re ce ss
 And on the last day
 Yeah
 You know
 I'm telling you
 Well I gave them st
 you know
 to the k
 and the ones that got good grades
 Well
 there are other things you can do besides

 you know
 You can have like
 You can make these little

 Do they have a laminating machine in the school
 Not in the school
 Well
 WH WH
 one
 one free lunch with the teacher
 Or one free lunch to sit with whoever you want at lunchtime
 I get to sit with my friends at lunch
 what
 Um if there's anything in the classroom that they really like to do

 have that be a privilege
 that nobody can do
 And then give those passes out for good behavior at the end of the day
 Choose the Mister Samuel way of teaching




 Or you can walk up to the chalkboard
 and you get really good


 and you
 Finally that man was fired
 man
 Oh
 He
 k
 He was the most

 and it'd be current events time
 we'd all be sitt ing there
 would just give him
 He was just talking
 Eli was just talking
 VOX Mister Samuel must have had a really bad day VOX

 He came up

 Q Alright you little shit
 I'm gonna F throw you against this wall F Q
 He threatened to throw the kid THUMP against the wall THUMP
 and we all
 Went home and told your parents
 freaked out

 No
 Because w
 to do anything
 And we would
 Q oh he's a great guy Q
 he would put on the bullshit
 He'd be fine

 no one believed the kids
 and actually bang their heads together
 WH What a guy WH
 Ken
 was actually very well behaved
 and really smart student
 went on to be one of those overachievers

 Just yanked him up
 Oh

 That's right
 That's righ t
 Mister Samuel had like
 the most
 unethical
 classroom
 I remember the
 the students
 I remember Muffin being terrified that she was going to be put in his class
 I saw Sally Samuel
 who is pregnant
 and has about
 You know
 Let's not discuss it
 But
 I was like
 Q Um

 how's your father Q

 I was kind of crude
 But I was like
 Is the man dead yet Q


 I was just very
 kind
 and and I said Q Oh really now Q

 That's a surpri se
 And the guy that he threatened to throw against the wall
 was put forward a year
 Eli graduated a year before I did


 It was a hush hush deal
 Didn't make
 an y sense
 It w
 Well he'd like
 Eli's parents probably tried to get him transfered out of his class
 And that was the on ly way to do it
 Definitely insa ne
 Hey Coop
 What I was gonna tell you about

 that the people principal and stuff they say to me
 Q Oh
 what you do with those third graders
 take them

 and and well behaved
 And you have them work as a team
 so that the fourth grader can help the third grader Q
 But that's bullshit
 Because
 that just teaches the third grader
 that he's worthless
 No it's not
 how many third graders do
 What's the ratio of third graders to fourth graders
 But they're not
 Okay
 Na
 Uh no
 I have like seventeen fourth graders and five third graders
 What
 No
 Seventeen
 fourth graders
 So then what you do is
 And you make the fourth grader s take the responsibility for teaching them

 Can you
 As long as it's
 Part of your
 FF Yes FF
 corp orate
 You bet
 Coop
 Well the third graders are just like
 y
 except for a couple who
 who are real smart
 WH darn WH

 I mean th
 You know
 Q Don't give them the answers
 Standing over

 I


 Have
 making mistakes is part of life
 that speech

 don't give away
 because you're d denying them of learning
 Mhm
 If y
 and they get it and they kind of go

 It shouldn't be multiple choice
 It isn't
 They should
 They should have to
 Like

 give them something to work on that there is no answer to
 But the other fourth graders it's like
 that is just opinion
 they don't really wan
 they don't want to help the kids
 they
 They wa
 and they get u ps et with me

 XXX help em to learn the basics

 they don't have the patience
 This is the funny one
 Q Well
 You know
 and these
 The thing is
 that the teachers that had these third graders before
 Cause they didn't teach them
 didd ly
 jack
 In the in the second grade I learned my times tables
 In the third grade I knew th
 Fourth grade was
 fractions
 I failed
 These kids can't do their times table s

 The fourth graders even
 Well they've just
 You know
 Wait
 they
 hey
 I didn't know times tables till s
 like fifth grade
 But
 Well were
 It was because you were a lazy butt
 I could not
 I could not do fractions
 And I mean with Samuel as a teacher
 who wants to tell them
 who wants to go up to this man and say

 Oh

 my whole fourth grade year
 And then there was a VOX possibility VOX the following year

 Cause our fifth grade tea cher was leaving

 So all of us were like



 We just
 man
 the first granola woman I ever met

 Granola wo man

 She would say
 VOX Let's go on a field trip
 We're gonna go on a hike VOX

 but to try and and talk me out of believing in Murphy's Law

 But I'm
 Hardly

 I mean
 this chapter on heaven an hell
 Why
 sort of
 standard line
 there were two things I got out of my marriage
 and one was a
 a child
 That
 really got me grounded
 the fact of the matter is
 that the marriage itself
 it's like it pulled me under
 giant shark
 And it pulled me all the way under
 and there I was
 then I found that I was on my own two feet again
 And it really was

 S what was hell in that that marriage became
 became a way out for me
 It was the flip side
 It's like sometimes you go through things
 and you come out the other side of them
 WH you WH come out so much better
 And if I hadn't had that
 if I hadn't had

 What do you mean
 What goes in one way

 doesn't come out XXX
 Kay

 Yeah
 So what did that have to d o
 But it's so good_ god
 k so good going down
 What did
 It's it's ma
 major league
 What does that have to do with heaven and hell in the book
 Well
 I'm just sort of reiterating
 I could read you some
 No I I don't want to hear anything out of a book with
 chapter called heaven and hell
 No
 Oh dear

 But
 I didn't like the book
 the way I
 You didn't
 That's because I have my own ideas about it
 That I'm pretty comfortable with
 ah
 I don't like re
 And I
 consider myself a real free thinker when it comes to that stuff
 Well
 And that's
 Remember
 remember it in the movie
 I mean books
 n they just become handbooks
 P No P
 no
 no I don't
 I don't
 I
 I come up with my own ideas about that stuff
 And where do you get the ideas
 Thought
 And where do you get those thoughts
 Well
 Isn't a book part of what goes on around you
 Well
 more from an oblique source
 when you're reading fiction
 or articles
 but but
 That someone's written about death
 Well
 What
 d
 what what this man has put in the boo
 I haven't read the book so I don't know
 but
 d
 from the Zen and
 f it just pools on other different
 different sources
 Well F it might all be bullshit F

 Th th the things I know most
 about life and death come from from my grandmother
 And having gone through all that
 With her
 And then it was interesting
 For two months
 About
 she had this dream of falling off a building
 Down o
 Just like that
 that cartoon we saw
 Falling
 Yeah
 yeah yeah yeah
 And it was like that
 And then she said that she dreamt about
 um
 all of her relatives
 that had died
 She wasn't dreaming about anybody who was living

 And I read that later
 um
 people who had technically died
 Saw relatives coming for them
 Course that may be what happens
 prior to the big
 the big nothing
 So why are you reading a book about dying
 P I don't know P
 you don't know
 I have an interest in it
 You're alive
 I've always been interested in it
 W Why W
 I mean


 Well
 With
 with

 and Bette Davis
 I couldn't believe

 I don't know
 I wanna say windbags
 Ha but what happens to them
 here's Betty Davis
 z yeah
 This incredible film legend
 And we think of her in Jezebel
 you know
 smoking cigarette smoke into the faces of William Holden and
 and the like
 You've never seen Betty Davis movie
 You've heard Kim
 The song Betty Davis Eyes
 And she's got
 And so she she lives
 I n

 What does that have to do with why you're reading a book on death

 I've always been interested in death
 F Why F

 WH WH
 yeah I'm laughing
 What is
 I'm thinking one thing my mother always used to say
 Pamela
 you are
 you are
 Q you'll be sorry when we're dead Q
 Mm
 So i w it's it's

 and I h
 you said to Deven
 And then we went to the Chalk Fair
 unhunh
 And he took off with Tobias
 Is that
 that I wanted to say with him well your dad wanted to spend time with you today
 And why did you run off
 And I didn't
 that my mother tried to guilt me the same way
 So that's why you're interested in death
 Maybe it's because my parents were old
 I've always
 thought it's weird
 that we've been
 I look down at my body
 And I feel like I'm in a spaceship
 Yeah

 WH WH
 n and

 Yeah
 Yeah
 inside of some woman's womb
 and I was burped out
 So


 trying to figure out what hap pens there
 Well
 n n
 Maybe I
 May
 No no no
 I
 maybe this whole lifetime was just a really rude interruption
 of what
 Of what ever it was I was doing
 before my number came up
 And I was told I had to come back here

 What if
 What if
 Unhunh
 gotten in the way
 Instead of just worrying about
 and making the best out of it
 Being here is
 is so illusive sometimes
 I mean illusionary
 Those are two different words
 I take back what I said about illusive


 Y you may be elusive

 well
 yeah but but but
 to me the whole point is is
 you have no idea
 You have no idea
 You can read books about it
 and you can talk about it
 but the most pragmatic thing to do is
 to just live it
 Hm
 Learn the rules of the game
 play the game
 for whatever you want
 For what ever you want
 Be a doctor
 VOX An explorer VOX
 Do what you want
 give
 whatever
 Love

 Could I love you


 Could I love you while I'm here VOX



 No
 Think about the kids
 What are
 W Who are these kids W

 These little seedpods
 that have been sent our way

 Well
 sometimes for me

 WH WH
 They're little
 little
 little lessons

 Yeah
 sometimes I have to be real prep
 What
 mom
 I mean
 I said a for real Santa Claus
 you mean a man who lives at the north pole
 She said yeah
 And she said
 they represent Santa Claus
 They
 they're a picture of Santa Claus

 They're pictures of Santa Claus
 Is my mike on
 It sure is
 And
 and then she said well
 And I kind of
 love fills the stockings
 She said
 she said
 adults

 Adults who wanna show you how much they care
 yeah
 Fill those stockings
 And I said
 they wanna believe in Santa Claus
 And that's what I told her
 In fact sometimes I do believe in Santa Claus
 And that
 that really satisfied her

 F But I thought it was very pragmatic of her to ask about that in June F
 I thought to myself
 I mean what does that have to do with death
 WH WH
 Well
 we were talking about
 death and illusions

 you know
 I
 I
 I

 was paradox
 Why
 Because
 I thought
 any word
 that was defined
 I mean I remember the definition
 That I learned in seventh grade
 That was paradox
 Seemingly contrary
 Seemingly P P
 and I had a hard time with the definition
 So I thought God
 A word
 That I'm supposed to learn
 and I get this definition
 Chew on this one
 Is that redundant

 WH WH
 Well
 that was age twelve
 So
 I sort of
 bit my teeth into that one
 And then



 I

 Is
 is that like cutting it in the nip


 I
 I get a little ahead of myself

 Yeah I guess you do

 Oh God I hope this doesn't all sound real stupid


 Well
 From
 from twelve to seventeen
 that went from paradox
 to
 the invisible
 interfacing with the visible
 Hunh

 inter facing with the visible
 Facing
 For everything you see
 You see eyes
 you see body


 S get your hands off me


 That's invisible
 It's not
 it's it's n
 I mean
 what if
 what if you took the same spacesuit
 And you put another spirit into it
 It would be a different person
 It'd say
 let me out
 a different person
 You're right
 So I
 I
 I think it's
 it's very interesti


 with who's inside of it
 I mean you don't know that
 Wouldn't that be f a fascinating experiment
 Genes
 Genetic makeup
 It's proven
 And that's part of the spacesuit
 That that your genetic makeup
 largely determines who you are
 You mean the chemical bath I sit in
 As it were

 Hm
 Sort of dictates how I feel about being in this spacesuit
 R you know
 My brain dolphin
 XX X
 you know
 I depend am
 A lot of it has to do with the with the
 the r
 five dollars and ninety eight cents worth of chemicals and compounds that make you
 We could spend a lot of our life
 Well

 it may be a very bad chemi cal bath

 We may

 Yeah
 that's right
 N well
 no apparent choice
 No choice
 that we know of
 Mn yeah
 Hm hm y yeah
 But but rather than than
 I mean I'm not
 I'm not
 I'm not all bent out of shape about it

 but I was thi
 You're just really interested in death

 my yearning is n
 maybe not to run ahead and

 and
 and
 As

 W
 I mean maybe it's the yearning
 for where I was before I was born
 Well how is write

 Anyone who sits down to write a book about death
 with the hopes of enlightening
 is in my book a schmuck
 Well now
 VOX them's fightin' words

 You could

 anyone
 who's living
 to sit down and write a book about death



 it's these
 this
 this is the person who falls under that that
 category of expert that I disdain so much
 I know a lot about
 Maybe he's a MRC very old soul MRC


 Plea se
 Like Old King Cole

 Well

 you know

 I felt l after Gretchen died
 it was all rather unfair
 the tides at work
 just swept over her so quickly

 Really
 That's why Marcia and Jim could get up and move

 They
 They thri
 They feed off of all these

 Th the friend that was there with them

 VOX And she was like a real pill

 with this hair pulled back
 in a little pony tail
 And she's like sitting there and VOX

 VOX well
 I don't know why


 Nothing was gonna help her
 No makeup

 VOX Would you move
 And then I realized

 And VOX there's Cassandra


 But then Liza wanted Antonio to see Mom's house
 So they go barging in on Mar
 So Mom felt obligated
 Also
 So the first thing

 She just looks at me

 She's terrified

 I am leaving Q
 So she wants to go out on the balcony

 and they're analyz
 They are so superficial

 He has a restaurant or something
 or wh
 He's a waiter at Rosa's

 he wants to open his own restaurant someday
 we're gonna finance it

 Actually thinks Cathy and Jawahar are
 Jonathan is
 life had changed now

 for her
 that
 and that there were
 gonna be
 all sorts of
 parasitic relatives distant or whatever
 coming up and saying
 Yes
 Trying to get him a job

 Oh yeah
 Well
 She doesn't understand it
 Well
 Q Well why Q

 Alin
 Uh Cathy

 you have this mega house
 and
 you know
 you have this

 But they

 they th
 the
 They like having people having to owe th


 S o
 That is a great line
 That's typical Thompson
 He is so funny
 But
 Not your professor PAR
 (Hx )

 No
 For this stupid New Year's Eve party then

 Tommy Spencer
 who's up there
 who y was Jonathan and Loren's best friend
 He
 opens his big mouth to Jonathan
 and she wants Jonathan's ph address
 She goes well we have to invite him to the New Year's Eve party

 She goes well Tommy Spencer opened his big mouth
 So you're going to host them are you
 She goes what do you mean

 She goes VOX no they're not
 And I said
 So next thing you know

 They were gonna go to this dinner party

 to see them
 Who cares

 Does she have any friends you think
 No
 up there
 No
 Why
 Cathy

 He is a nice guy
 he doesn't understand how to mix friends at all
 We already went through that
 he
 and he was friends with this other idiot from New Zealand
 And one night
 So he invited Doctor Spargo out with Dennis
 I did not like him
 Period
 And Spargo was okay
 And we go out
 and

 or we went out
 and these guy
 they were at each other's throats
 MRC the whole night long
 Competition galore MRC
 Really
 Oh yeah
 Each one was fighting for our affection s

 That was very apparent
 Plus they didn't like each other
 Spar
 you know
 If we went to parties
 he'd keep em away
 Just like a little t

 Running around
 VOX rar rar rar rar rar rar VOX

 It was a lot of fun
 Whoops
 I'm sorry
 MIC But
 Cathy and Jawahar don't understand how to mix their friends at all
 MIC They don't understand
 not to have everybody MIC at the same party

 Is she work ing

 you know

 What does this mean

 Wasn't she
 she's too into computers

 They're boring


 but I think that you can get caught up in computers


 You gotta sit there
 you you know
 oh you
 and RAM
 you know

 and she
 I know
 She's passionate about it
 I'm like

 I just
 I really don't care
 I
 That was absolute
 Hector wouldn't go
 He said
 Okay sweets
 And I don't
 Joy I like
 Cause she's really interesting
 But a lot of those other paddlers are idiots
 I did not wanna go
 So I walk in
 I walk in
 and the first hint that there's
 this is gonna be something a little bit unusual
 ut
 up at the ceiling
 With metallic colored streamers coming down
 So I walk in and I see
 two of the paddlers I definitely don't wanna see

 One of which had a Halloween party
 I said why the hell didn't you tell me you were leaving
 VOX Oh
 you know
 you know
 where I got insulted
 by this other little assistant twat
 thank God
 But anyway


 then
 you know
 That really irritated me
 You know

 What do you mean
 yes
 ha
 I'm having a party

 But anyway




 So I have this pair of suede pants that I got


 where

 so there's
 you know
 and they're going
 VOX oh

 So I'm sitting there talking to these idiots for a while


 this new wave of people comes in

 And these three guys walk in and
 one guy
 was so geeky
 Who the hell do you know
 I mean who is this geek
 So anyway
 the other guy had a real nice shirt on
 So the guy with the nice shirt came in
 and he's
 and Joy's father had hired him to
 to sell
 in Hawaii
 from her father's store
 But now he's sells v_real estate in Malibu
 and he's got a painting con contracting whatever
 and
 one of the things that they're doing
 is
 is painting this building on Melrose
 plastic first
 But his renditions of P homosexuals
 I thought I was gonna die P
 And I
 I hadn't
 you know
 I just looked at him
 He was going on and on
 how these guys
 and
 he was just going on and on and on
 I never even thought about it
 Because I grew up in the Swish Alps
 You know

 We have been here our whole lives
 and I said I never knew anybody who was in the closet
 Well he couldn't handle this
 God
 So
 And I said
 And he goes VOX exactly right VOX
 He's a thoracic surgeon

 or some horse manure

 it's just like
 this
 right here in my face



 Oh shit
 I kept t
 I said I don't

 I said
 it's a little difficult having three in the same bedroom


 A
 You know
 But


 he' s

 he didn't believe me
 That I was married
 He thought I was giving him the brush off
 That's cool
 So they had their other friend come over and meet me
 and they were like blown away
 They were saying
 well that's what happens when you're this VOX elderly age VOX
 But
 meanwhile
 in had walked these two really s
 kind of scruffy looking guys
 you know not
 Cause these guys were all SNAP like
 Mister Hip SNAP
 And here comes these two other guys
 and one's this White guy with this beard
 And he's got like a Lorimar sweatshirt on
 So I'm sitting there and
 the
 D

 you know
 DR doctor
 Yeah but that's all he'd give his name for

 he's had an interesting command of the English language
 You know

 And he started talking to one of the other paddlers
 and he used the same lines on her
 Oh well

 he was like really bored and left

 when DR walked off
 and
 you know
 all of a sudden you're realizing
 complicated sentences together
 and
 y he knows what you're talking about
 literary terms

 He's a
 He's a army brat
 And has
 He speaks fluent German
 He's lived in about thirty places
 And I said God
 that must have really made you
 d you know
 it's
 you must have a good time at making new friends
 also what it'd done
 so he read a lot
 So he's really self taught
 you know
 kind of
 one of the things he did was he
 kind of took up the guitar at twelve
 Now he's thirty five
 The guy with the beard
 was his good buddy
 The guy with the beard must be about
 six four
 and
 His parents were
 He put himsel
 went through fire science major at UCLA
 They go through this stupid fire science major out at UCLA
 And now he
 and he's
 he's
 putting himself
 And he's going to CSUN

 Brilliant
 you know

 talking to him
 he had a big old hicky here
 Oh God

 The Black guy laughed
 He goes


 But the Black guy's father works with the
 CIA
 Oh
 you 're kidding
 no


 I had a ball
 I ended up
 you know
 and
 all the paddlers were going
 VOX yeah
 Are you

 like I told DR
 VOX just cause I'm married


 I still like to go to parties
 I'm sorry



 Shit

 And he goes

 So you're married
 He's married too

 And he goes
 oh
 Well that makes it convenient then

 VOX I always like it when
 both of you are married to each o ther VOX

 And I said
 so do I
 (H )

 XX Hector
 Oh God
 Poor little Hector
 He's been having a hell of a time
 Pulling his hair out
 He's been grumpy for three months
 Well

 He was actually talkative tonight
 He talked to me
 Do you know how long it's been since he's been able to k talk to me on the phone
 Kevin
 No
 Uh well

 and then it's
 and then they don't have the third editor
 But it's so nice
 Him and Ke vin

 Yeah
 Yeah
 Kevin's his assistant
 But they're trying to get Kevin to
 Otherwise known as VOX Nixon VOX
 Who's gonna take Hector's


 Who's gonna
 nix it
 Nixon

 So
 It
 I don't know
 They gonna bring in some
 neurotic from New Jersey

 Part of the problem with this whole thing was
 that
 was that Ellen was not relinquishing t her duties
 And b it makes sense
 Hector had an Emmy
 nomination
 I would let him run editorial
 They clipped his wings
 There are three shows in trouble
 He was not allowed to help on any of em
 None of em
 That's changed now though
 like he was before again
 Yeah
 so unless they f
 they
 They have to look for an editor
 I don't know what he's gonna do
 He wants to work actually features


 I went and saw their house the other night
 Where is it
 It's um

 It's one of those streets off of there

 It's a nice little
 or south
 of Sunset
 Oh
 I know
 How crass
 True cuz
 But it's in
 who's
 one of the biggies at MTM
 or
 oh I forgot which one


 It all means the same to me
 You know

 Hector was s
 the show last week
 And I
 and I called up to talk to him

 I could hear the
 the musicians in the back ground tuning up their instruments

 And then
 you know
 and it's okay to talk to Hector
 I could hear him a little bit
 No shit

 I can't hear you at all
 sweetheart

 Call me
 when I can hear you
 It was funny
 That's the only part I'll miss
 So

 His position is pretty
 stable
 Yeah
 Fletcher
 Well see
 So Hector's the one
 when was it
 Two weekend
 Two weekends ago
 He
 c he said
 Q p_so
 Lina
 what happens on Hanukkah Q
 And I was going
 I can't exactly remember the story
 all I know is you light a candle
 And he goes
 I said what
 h he di
 never told me why he was calling up Fletcher
 so

 I'm calling Fletcher
 I said Q okay
 go ahead Q
 So he called Fletcher
 and Fletcher was so relieved
 Cause he wanted to ask Hector to move back to editorial
 He's just happy he did it
 Because he's so unhappy with the editorial staff
 That they couldn't get what they wanted out of Sherry

 and they couldn't get what it they wanted out of Seppie
 It's actually not Seppie's fault
 but that Sherry was impossible
 She was a witch
 And then her assistant pulled stunts where she didn't do stuff
 which I wouldn't know
 but cause I'm no assistant
 But
 making sure that the script gets to the people doing the sound effects
 She totally screwed up the the show that they're working on now
 I don't know what number that is

 Well
 v the one they're working on's not always the one that's being shown
 But what one is tonight
 Tonight
 I don't know
 Four
 Five

 Six
 This i
 I don't know
 We'll have to ch
 if this was really number two
 H m
 like you said
 Because they had such a b hard time with it
 It had so much wrong with it
 Hector kept trying to get it corrected
 And they kept stopping him
 Cause of her
 Cause of her
 cause of Jake
 Nixon
 And it makes him look like an idiot
 cause he's the director
 Has nothing whatsoever to do with anybody else
 It's Jake
 But he'll s
 That's stupid
 So now Fletcher's starting to realize what's going on
 It's hard
 because
 the hatchet man actually in the group is Ed
 Ed's the one that'll come in
 and he'll go ahead and say
 this is what needs to be done
 Okay
 and h
 You know
 But
 Fletcher'll kind of sit there and kind of go
 that
 He's too
 namby pamby
 You need somebody to come in and go



 Yeah
 t_So
 they're kind of suffering that
 from that this year
 Not having that on there
 But
 Yeah
 And they can't afford that right now
 How many countries is it in
 M m
 All I know is
 Oh really
 I forgot what it's called
 Some thing
 It's about
 has to do with the bar generation
 Um

 The bar gen era
 Uh
 What
 L Pub L
 The Pub
 The Pub Generation



 So Cathy
 g
 WH Oh God WH

 VOX I know cuz
 I thought that was really funny
 The pub Generation VOX
 Have it in France
 I know
 And they

 Harlan's wife
 Where
 They had dinner with her one night

 Yeah

 VOX oh
 You mean she's not so chubby VOX
 Ooh
 Was that nasty
 God
 Stay up late
 Kinda defeats the purpose of getting up in the morning
 I know
 And it's a hard habit to break
 Usually I don't
 s Usually I don't stay up late
 But it's like
 It's just like
 Hm
 Yeah yeah


 I still can't
 God I still can't believe Tim bitching around and
 he lied too
 He said that he talked to Ron
 About the way they were feeling
 of them being the only ones cleaning the house
 I mean what they don't realize
 shit
 I wanna spend time with Ron
 usually doesn't get home till nine or ten
 Yeah
 for every little dime that he makes
 You know
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Tim is on salary
 and he earns leave
 he's
 he gets sick leave
 we don't get shit
 I don't know
 It is really hard living with another couple
 I mean
 we
 If we set our
 If we sit down and set some rules
 it could work
 You know
 Mhm
 what it amounts to
 he told him
 he goes
 what was it he goes
 nobody fucks with my lifestyle
 I feel the exact same way
 And all those bitches and complaints that he has
 they're about my lifestyle
 Mhm

 Well
 you know
 And the only way it's gonna work
 That's right
 going to our parents
 and complaining about one another
 I'm gonna tell him
 you talk to the person that you have the complaint about
 I'm also going to suggest
 MRC weekly house meetings MRC to discuss such things
 Mhm
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 in self assertiveness
 you know and
 especially the way
 I mean Tim gets in himself into a
 and his first reaction is to blow up about it
 You know
 cause he let
 Yep
 He doesn't do nothing positive about it
 And if something bothers you
 I was
 when I was asked to take over intermediate algebra
 Unhunh
 And teach it

 And I did
 And I also went
 and I asked for a raise
 instead of
 cause instead of just sitting in the class and getting five dollars an hour
 Mhm
 and instead of getting the five dollars an hour
 Really
 Now if i
 You know if you put a situation like that to Tim or Mandy
 cause not because they're they're weak in character or anything
 but because they're
 They're babies
 Yeah
 They hem and haw around
 You know
 Yeah

 I don't know
 And it's
 Right now
 I don't know if I should mention it to him
 I'm feeling like he's taking me for granted
 Yep
 And he's rolling in it
 And you know what the sad thing
 the thing that really scares me
 is that they're n
 th at the rate they're going
 and with all the breaks that they've gotten
 they're never gonna have hard times
 Hard times do train you
 Yep
 They do
 Like I came over here to work with Danae
 I'm going to do some translations for her and stuff
 Yeah
 tonight
 And
 you know
 I have to make at least fifty dollars or so
 but like tonight
 well I called
 you know
 so I called
 Mandy's
 or
 I called our house
 and I said where's
 you know where's
 where
 When we were on our way to Tim's game
 and he asked what time we'd be home
 And she said then we went over to your grandma's
 but then we came back
 So
 I called the Town Pump
 course he wasn't
 he was on his way home
 And I said tell
 So I called Mandy back
 have him call me
 when he got home
 So
 I was in the bathtub when he called
 and I talked to him for a while and
 he went and
 he was really down about what what I told him that Tim had said to me
 and how I was so upset
 He goes Q why didn't you tell him to go and wake me up Q
 I said I did
 Really
 He goes
 they w
 they were sitting around getting all fucked up
 he said I went right to bed
 Oh
 Cause that five car pile up they had between Hardin and Crow
 Oh
 Yeah
 Ron was singlehandedly there
 with one wrecker
 G yeah

 Seems like any time I've seen a wrecker out here
 Hm m
 Oh
 so he had to send Ron by himself
 Did they all hit each other
 Kind of
 A a semi bumped a car
 went on two wheels
 just about lost it
 and then got back up on all all its wheels again
 Oh
 Did it land in the ditch
 But it
 Kind of
 but all the other cars that were in the direct vicinity
 And then
 there was three cars and the semi
 And then
 this
 this guy pulled up and
 he was going to
 Peggy

 Yeah
 Him and her pulled up
 And they stopped to ask Ron what happened
 And here another car came and rear ended em
 Oh
 And they ended up having to take Peggy White by helicopter to Billings
 Man that's pretty bad
 I know
 Darn
 this darn dog keeps breathing
 and like dreaming
 you know I wonder if we should wake her up
 No
 she'll get scared and want to go outside
 Kinda nervous
 They say you can really mess up a dog
 Really
 Mhm
 It's so cold outside
 You know what I was thinking of doing
 I don't know
 what it would be like to train her
 to pull a sled
 I don't know if she'd do it
 I don't know if she would either
 She's kind of timid
 Mhm
 She doesn't trust too many people at all
 Yeah
 Oh and you know another thing that Tim had the audacity to bitch about
 What
 He said
 Mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree
 until four in the morning
 And I even asked if we could put our ornaments on there
 and they told me that there wouldn't be enough room
 Really
 Tim said that
 She was probably lonely when she was doing it
 She probably was

 I mean
 what was I gonna do
 she was just putting up the balls and everything and
 she'd say Q where
 where do you think this should go Q and
 so I was sitting there doing my Welfare application
 And
 you know I was just sitting there watching her
 telling her where to put everything and what not
 Did you know Nickie wanted her own tree
 Yes
 And I forgot to bring it in
 What are you gonna do with it
 She wants to set it up for her Barbies
 I was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom
 Mhm
 And just stick it in there
 And you know what I did
 so I just cut a branch off one
 God
 I fell up there

 to get em
 You know where Sarah and Arvela live
 Mhm
 Just around the corner
 Remember that first cattle guard you go over
 Unhunh
 You mean
 kinda like by the
 by the tunnel
 Oh
 And I just walked up
 We just walked up around
 God Alice that was fun
 Did you get grandma a tree too
 Does she already have one
 Hm m
 That pickup could only hold like three
 Mm
 I wonder why
 Did daddy say to take the pickup back
 Yeah
 Cause Phoebe needs it
 What's wrong with the car

 Oh
 about how the engine was on fire
 Mhm
 See there was oil spilling out
 leaking out from the valve cover
 Mhm
 and the oil got hot
 Well
 because we were losing oil bad
 going from Billings to Crow

 there's a lot of
 smoke coming out
 we had to put like
 three or four quarts in
 Unhunh
 It was three
 And
 by the time we got to

 Crow
 it was
 it was one quart low
 And there was smoke still coming from under the engine
 then it caught fire
 cause there wasn't enough water in the radiator
 Mhm
 well I checked
 it was only about
 But that shouldn't make any difference
 is that there was an air lock in there
 And that running the engine out on the open road
 Mh m
 flushed it out
 And bust th e gasket
 No
 it would more or less
 the engine wasn't being kept cool enough
 Cause there wasn't enough fluid in the radiator
 And
 Yeah
 So what
 caused the f ire
 The engine being too hot
 and the oil leaking
 So he knew that the oil was leaking
 we knew we were losing oil
 Just from lifting up the hood and looking at it
 So what's he gonna do
 Well
 and two of his wires
 Unh unh
 Unhunh
 So we took those off and we
 replaced them with some old ones out of the garage
 I knew that
 It runs
 There's enough
 radiator fluid in there
 Mhm
 so that it will
 It's it's enough
 Mhm
 But I think running it out on the open road
 will cause it possibly to shoot more oil out
 Mhm
 Hm

 I don't know
 Oh I freaked Cookie and
 Rita and
 Gary out tonight
 Remember the Plain Plainfeather Claypit
 where that red clay is
 Mhm
 Right there
 I saw my my speedometer just go Brr
 like that just down
 You know
 What I have to do
 Mhm
 Because my fuel pump is now electric
 Never used to be
 Mhm
 Hand me that ashtray
 Or your light
 P Your light P
 It's behind the sewing machine

 And
 sometimes it gets loose

 And no more HI fuel HI
 So I had Cookie turn on the ignition and turn it off
 So
 cause see
 then you hear the
 the fuel pump come on
 Mhm
 And if the wire's not connected right
 it doesn't come on
 Mhm
 So I did that
 and I lit a match to find out where I was
 n after everything was hunky dory
 then I
 shut the hood
 both Gary and Rita were sitting on the edges of their seat
 And I turned around and I looked
 and I said
 Q did I scare you kids Q
 They wouldn't say anything
 Q yeah




 But I freaked em out
 I don't know
 Then daddy said something about the steering column on my car needing ((MATCH_STRIKE))_work
 Mhm
 Said long as I don't drive it fast
 But oh man I don't know
 See the thing about it is
 if I go after Ken
 Mhm
 to
 you know
 I'm not saying I'm gonna pay for everything
 I don't want to be broke around him

 Cause I wanna at least be able to put gas in the car
 Mhm
 I don't think it's such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter
 Mm
 I've been thinking about that
 We should all get some money together and
 is there any way he could like

 Cause I'd like to go up there and go to the

 Red Lobster
 Really
 Yeah
 Cause I've been just
 craving seafood
 Yeah
 When though
 I don't know
 He goes back to school like the second

 VOX Oh
 Well isn't there any way
 like we
 that we could just meet him up there and
 maybe
 Bring him down
 I don't wanna take your car

 I was gonna ask you and mom
 if you could
 take care of Trace for a couple days next week
 Oh
 What you got in mind
 I need to get caught up on my work
 Wednesday I have an appointment at nine thirty
 Mom's off
 Oh
 That's right
 Yeah I think that'd
 I think that'd
 work out
 like if she had to go shopping or something maybe you could go with her
 And then of course he adores me

 Mhm
 I remember I was pregnant with Nicky
 And
 he really liked me
 when I was pregnant with her
 You know how it is when we're pregnant
 we get real sleepy
 I'd fall asleep on the couch
 Mhm
 And he'd fall asleep with me
 And I remember he would
 I woke up
 Mhm
 and God
 Was
 Was Nicky mad when Trace was a boy
 Kind of
 She thinks I should have twins
 Twin girls
 (COUGH COUGH)
 But I don't think she'll realize the
 sibling rivalry

 But I don't know
 she's six years old now
 And they say that if there's six years between children
 After four there's almost none
 Really
 Mhm
 Cause they're
 they're kind of in different worlds
 Yeah
 Because
 see
 the next time I have a baby
 Trace will probably be
 about three
 four
 Hm
 That's when I'm gonna get this shit taken out

 Tammy Kashen has one of these too
 What is it
 Norplant
 Oh really
 Deon told me
 Cause I asked him what his intentions were with her
 Cause I told him I thought he was too young to be so involved
 Gwen was telling me that
 Did she talk to you lately
 They had a cyst on her ovary
 And they had to go in and take it out
 Mhm
 Take out that cyst
 And it's really screwed up her
 menstrual p
 her hormones
 And they said that she might have to get pregnant again
 WH WH
 So
 and then she goes
 Q so tell

 I don't know if Tammy would be too happy with that though
 Seems to me that she's trying to straighten herself out
 pursue a family
 Tammy
 What do you think
 I don't know
 Or do you think it might be a matter of convenience
 I think it's a convenience for both of em
 Yeah
 Yeah
 It's also a convenience for Cookie
 Oh yeah

 Um
 The
 The way that your testimony is FOOTSTEPS coming in
 I don't know if I explained this to you o n the ph one
 when a person is charged with multiple crimes
 and
 there are other incidences
 When we have to prove
 to expose himself to a person
 for sexual arousal

 when we have to prove something like specific intent

 Because he's disputing identity in a coup
 in at least one of the cases
 Um
 prior similar conduct
 Um
 where he acted in a
 an identical way
 That's why we're able to have you come in and testify
 Um
 the cases that we have
 already
 are

 one happened back in October of nineteen ninety

 and it's almost a carbon copy of your case
 one a year from
 almost a year from the
 police report
 matter of fact it was just over the phone
 a nd
 and said they were gonna do something about it
 Okay
 So it hap pened around

 Yeah
 um
 that's great
 Yeah
 Um




 Um
 i
 Amelia Gonzalez

 that
 And she was seated a in the rear of the train
 which you were
 nobody else was around
 and he sort of walked up and down the train
 Mhm
 and then sat dow n
 put the newspaper on his lap
 Yeah
 for her to see
 And she saw it
 in the the re flection
 n n
 Oh
 cause she was looking out the window
 Right
 and lifting up the paper
 Um
 so
 anyway
 it c
 and

 he sits through all the testimony
 you know
 U m


 she was riding on BART
 and
 he came and sat near her
 she moved
 he moved to get closer to her
 she moved again
 and he moved directly oppo site her

 So
 well see
 what it is
 it seems like he wants someone more scary
 y I don't know
 he would walk up and down the aisles
 look like you can intimidate someone
 I i

 I think that's
 and he goes for a certain age group
 Um
 and
 you know like
 So
 anyway
 okay
 um
 did you
 as far as your

 mileage STAPLE goes
 What would did
 Okay
 And we got the
 P that ticket for our P
 Parking
 They moved the gate or something
 The
 cause it used to be on

 Bec ause they built this bui lding
 Oh
 See
 Oh no
 there was a door here before
 I couldn't find it

 Um
 oh okay
 Oh no
 Um
 do you guys have the cash to pay for it right now
 When you to get out
 Yeah I think so
 Then what I'll do is
 when
 you can
 I'll call you and find out
 What I have to do is
 and they give you the
 they'll mail you the reimbursement
 So you guys hang on to that
 I imagine it will be about five dollars or so
 Um
 so
 PAPERS a hundred and thirty
 about a hundred and thirty five you think
 Yeah
 So round trip it'll be like t wo seve nty
 two si
 PAPERS WRITING

 That's from Salinas
 Mhm

 WRITING
 Do you go by Rickie Reeding R Reeding Rollins
 or do you just go by Rickie Rollins
 Uh r
 well my name is Regina
 Okay
 I don't know if you have to put my Regina in there
 um i

 You guys newly married
 Well just a year
 A year two days ago


 Soon you'll be in my condition



 Thanks
 Okay
 Let's just go through

 I I have your statement
 but I just want to have you tell me
 Alright
 U m
 do you remember the date
 No
 Okay
 Because I'll be
 VOX saying to you VOX
 Q do you recall
 nineteen ninety two Q
 and it was about one o'clock
 So
 first of all
 where did you get on BART
 At Oakland
 Okay
 Um
 to the doctor's
 in San Francisco
 San Francisco
 And
 when you got on BART
 I'll ask you to describe where you sat
 on the tr ain

 what I have
 This is a diagram of the interior of BART
 Okay looking at that
 okay
 can you

 Um
 that's the train
 u That seat right there
 I have
 So
 um
 And it's hard to describe how
 so

 Okay

 when he came in
 when where was he when you first saw him c ome in
 H e got on the train on like
 in Oakland
 VOX And like in a
 let me see VOX
 Okay
 He got on another car
 But you can
 I I seen him
 So I seen him when the
 you know how the train goes
 well he got in another door
 Alright
 So he came through he re
 did he look at you at all
 he had a
 just kinda looked
 and then looked
 and then walked
 Okay
 Yeah
 looking you up and down
 did he just look at your seat
 wh at
 you know
 u h I guess

 Di
 cause
 I always sit all the way to the window
 Actually
 Okay
 And then he continued on
 He went all the way to the
 you know
 into the train
 he went through the door
 again
 Okay
 He went through th ere
 Oh
 And then he came back again
 and then
 I guess that was like another stop
 and then
 that's when he came and sat by me
 sat in this seat right here
 But
 there was someone sitting there too
 but she got up
 and she went to another seat
 Ah
 Okay
 but he was making
 Or you may smell or some thi ng
 as he wanted her to move
 Okay
 And she got up and m oved
 Um
 and
 was there anybody seated

 I think maybe like
 you know how these chairs are
 you know
 Alright
 So then
 what did he do
 Um
 did the newspaper
 looking at it
 making loud noises
 I guess so I think like that or whatever
 then
 he just kept doing that to the newspaper like that
 and then he just
 you can just see him going like this
 you know how you have to unzip your pants
 and I'm looking through the window
 and then he's still making noises with the paper
 and then
 I kinda looked
 and then I didn't and I kept making like
 Q s WH you know like WH Q
 you know like Q I know what you're Q
 you know
 Q Q
 You know I remembered him for a year
 from a year ago
 And so
 and he just kept B hitting the paper
 like that
 B you know
 He kept hitting the paper
 and

 kinda looked over
 and then you can see it
 You know
 you can see it
 Had he lifted up the paper in any way
 Yeah
 you know
 Okay

 like
 like this
 just like
 you know
 You know
 The MRC whole entire time MRC
 not looking
 at PAPER first he would go like this
 with the paper
 And look at me
 You know
 Yeah
 then the whole time under here
 I mean
 he looked so hard
 you know what I mean
 It

 That's
 I mean that's gr eat
 alright

 of drawing your attention to him
 if somebody's doing that to you
 there's no way you're gonna
 you know
 just totally ignore them
 cause you're always going to wanna keep them in your peripheral vision
 to ma ke sure where they a re
 Yeah

 So let them know that he was do ing that
 Alright
 Um
 okay
 and then
 he sort of pulled the paper aside
 just
 and then
 but when
 like you come to a stop
 You know
 like about
 five minute ride or something
 and we got to like Embarcadero
 PAPER he would just
 until I had to get off at my stop
 Tell the jury about that too
 and if there was a chance that any man might w alk by
 y
 You know
 I have a pr report from another case where
 um
 he wa
 and then when a man would walk by
 And
 you know
 then he'd go back doing it
 Okay
 So
 Um
 o kay so then you got off

 at your stop
 Um
 and how were you feeling
 Well
 P it was like P
 CRY s I don't know
 sorry

 You doing alright
 just
 you know
 why I really wanted to report it this time because
 You know the kids and every thing
 I was
 you know
 abuse like that or
 That's what I was think
 it was just like this dirty old man
 And this time
 and
 I just felt like
 you know
 and I just
 I just felt upset
 Okay
 n CRY
 Um
 it's it's real ly important that they understand
 the feelings that go through you when sombody does something like that to you

 my one concern about this case is
 um
 that some people may have the a ttitude of
 he never touched you
 he didn't make any verbal threats to you
 it's no big deal Q
 And
 I have some young single men
 on my jury panel
 And
 I
 my worry is that they don't relate to what a woman feels
 whe n so mething like that is happening
 if a man exposes himself
 a man would never do that
 I think more vulnerable peo ple
 But if
 um
 a man were to be exposed to
 they would laugh
 or
 you know
 or be mad
 but they would n't ne cessari ly feel
 scared or threat ened
 Hi
 Um
 so r relate that information to the jury
 Um
 and then

 you called the poli ce
 and I just
 I was still kind of like shocked
 and then there was a different person down there
 when I called the BART police
 you know and

 couple of days after
 one of the
 detectives
 called me and then I made a report
 we just made a report and he said
 he'll submit it and everything
 a nd y ou ID'ed him immediately
 Alright
 I have
 a and this is
 Unhunh
 yeah
 we've got the statement where you immediately said I'm hundred percent sure this is the guy
 Okay
 What is he a old man
 He's like sixt ies
 In his
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Go dX
 And he' s like balding like
 Um
 See that's why I'm s
 I can't breathe
 She she'll ju
 That's why she's crying
 Okay
 m how
 Do I have to look at anyone
 or
 Okay

 when you go in
 Um
 you you don't have to
 you know
 if you feel like you need to take a break
 then tell me immediately
 Um
 or ask the judge
 Um
 I was saying to June
 that
 um
 there'll be twelve people seated in the juror box
 Mhm
 an d u m
 you know they could be your family
 They could be your friends
 Um
 y y from all walks of li fe
 and
 um
 you know
 So
 they just want to hear your story
 and they're not judging you
 Um
 PAPER let me show you
 XX baby
 Hm
 Hm m
 Mhm
 Yes unhunh
 Good PAPER
 She was going crazy all day here
 I was like Q that ain't him Q
 Q That's him


 VOX I don't know where I drew it out VOX
 (THR OAT)

 So is he in like jail or something
 No he's out right now
 Oh o kay
 Oh o kay
 we asked for ninety days county jail before the case
 went to trial
 um
 it'll be higher
 if he's convicted
 Okay
 plus he's got your case pending in Oakland
 if we get a conviction just on one case here
 then
 Oh
 So
 um
 Yu
 W what will happen is
 you'll walk into the courtroom here
 Mhm
 um
 that are for the audience
 um
 and
 then
 there are two tables right here
 I'll be seated at this table
 And
 the defendant and the defense attorney will be seated at this tab le
 The jury sits here
 Okay
 all in a row
 u m
 and you'll walk thr
 Okay
 um to the ch the witness chair
 o kay
 Alright
 And the judge is seated right here
 And then there's a woman who sits here who's the clerk
 And so when I ask you questions

 always say yes or no
 as opposed to Q unhunh Q or Q unh unh Q
 okay

 if your nervous
 please tell me
 Um
 and
 take your time
 when you walk in just take a deep breath
 Okay
 If I ask you a question that you don't understand
 Um
 if we either of us ask you a question where
 Um
 it's a detail that you don't remem ber
 Okay
 Um
 Is there gonna b
 the other person
 his lawyer gonna ask some questions
 Yeah
 He's
 he's a very polite guy
 He's a young attorney
 um
 he's
 um
 w when we had the case the last time
 it was a different attorney
 And th at attorney terrorized my
 my one victim that I put on
 um
 he walked up to her
 and he was about this far away from her
 sh
 when he walked in initially and he looked at me
 PAR Walter Munson PAR
 she said
 I I knew he was a pervert
 just by the way he looked at me
 Oh
 So this man walked up to him and he said
 And

 just badgered her
 but thi s this attorney is not like that at all
 um
 he's going to try and focus more on

 discrepancies
 you know
 in your

 you know
 he sat down
 right across from you
 um
 But
 for the most part he'll be polite and gentle
 So you don't have to worry about him
 Hm
 Um
 what hap
 well tell me about the year ago incident
 Um
 that one was at night time
 And

 I remember I used to get off ar around nine
 and I used to get to
 the Bart station around ten o'clock
 And
 he would be
 I think
 P I'm trying to think
 Well that's the Daly City one
 so he would get on
 when I would get on
 but I think probably like a different car
 same thing
 exact
 Go up and down the aisles
 You know
 he would do that
 I was terrified then
 I
 you know
 you know
 you know
 when people are around
 down at the other seat s or in back

 at night time he was doing the same thing
 to the Bart police
 I never heard anything again
 So
 um
 Did he use a newspaper that time al so
 Yeah
 and the funny thing is
 he just
 the only thing he changed this time
 is
 and a different bag
 cause he always had a bag
 cause the
 what made the interested in this case
 well
 everyone's telling me he has this bag
 that's the only difference
 And they were like Q okay Q
 M
 let me see
 a duffel bag
 I think

 P
 Like a sh
 like a old be
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 That's his common one
 plastic bag filled with paper s
 Y eah
 Yeah
 Ok ay
 Okay


 Now you can't do anything to this guy


 I'm just gonna sit back and look

 M hm

 She just don't have no control over her body
 WH Tr ain WH
 When will the verdict be
 Um
 well
 Uh you two are my last witnesses
 and then the defendant will t esti fy
 And then
 And then
 w we should have a verdict by Friday afternoon
 O kay
 So I'll call all of you and tell you

 He says so
 Mhm
 H What could he BR possibly say BR
 He testified in a trial
 um
 about five years ago
 Sa identical situa tion
 and he said
 his testimony was
 He totally denied it
 So
 cause I was just telling him

 She was
 I don't know
 you know
 you're saying f ive years ago
 but he used to
 I don't know
 she she didn't say anything newspaper whatever
 do finish the job
 so
 They're hard cases

 to act on
 and I think the reason why they finally started acting on these
 and getting the identificatio n
 Do you have any questions June

 No
 Okay
 Um
 I'm going to put June on first
 Okay
 and then
 then Rickie
 And then will you let us know what the final verdict is
 P Hm P
 Hopefully it's good news
 If it's not
 I'll be bummed


 Cause I've been living with this case now for so long


 Am I doing that right so far
 Mhm
 All the way down to that
 Mhm
 WH I WH think
 I don't think I am
 And you'd have to have that plus or minus

 Where did I get that square root of

 ex squa red
 Because you brought this over here
 You brought three over here
 divided by three
 and then you have ex squared
 I guess all I can't figure out is
 what the square root of negative two thir thi two thirds is
 Would that be
 i square root two
 o over three
 The whole thing would be over three
 Square root of two thirds

 Oh
 WH gosh WH
 hm
 Leah
 She snoozing on the floor
 Mhm
 Not anymore


 She's doing the karate kid
 She's like
 Do I deserve this



 I'd probably just slap em
 P Ex squared equals one over the square root of that
 the square root of that
 ex equal s the square root of one P
 like
 I know
 That's what I'm talking about

 So
 would that one be
 square root of one half
 Mhm
 It would
 Mhm
 Yep
 But do y'all have to do that

 you have to like
 have it where you do that
 there's no

 fraction under the
 under the
 in the denominator
 I mean no fraction under the
 So then you just multiply

 Even f or the top one
 Even for that one
 No
 For
 Oh
 All you do is like go
 t two over one
 M m
 Since you have the square root of two on the bottom
 to make that a square
 And then you get two
 and you multiply the top by the square root of two
 and you get
 square root of two



 Cause I sure didn't catch it the first time





 So
 let's talk about this slowly
 Alright
 This is what we came out with
 It's
 over the square root of two
 Oh
 And then you multiply that by the square root of two
 Uh
 That's what I was try


 That's what it was
 square root of two over two
 Mhm
 See everything was square root two
 Right
 what about this one

 you have i
 you have i square root of three
 over square root of three
 I mean z
 i square root of two over three
 square root of three
 I can't even say it right

 Over
 do I have another i down here
 or just the one i
 no
 Just one
 Okay
 P three and square root of three

 i square root of six
 Yeah
 Over three
 Is that right
 I doubt it
 I really do

 You can't
 You can't multiply
 square roots like that
 Square root of two
 times square root of three
 is square root of six
 is it
 Yeah
 Okay
 Well
 then that's fine
 Then that is right
 Isn't that c
 Yeah
 Cause that's the same way you're multiplying there
 square root of nine
 that
 Yeah
 P okay P
 Where's the test
 P There ain't no telling P

 I mean I have it

 Okay
 The next one
 is

 five ex
 times ex minus one



 equals
 two
 times one minus ex
 Leah

 Yeah
 And that's easy
 Oh this is easy
 P Ex squared P
 Please say this will factor
 Will it
 Na
 you do it
 Well
 It does
 Mhm
 One and negative two fifths
 Mhm
 And I can al ways put tho se back up into the top
 and see if they check
 Let me just try the one
 Five
 I got zero equals zero


 Yeah

 Zero equals zero equals one
 Okay
 SING Fingerprint file
 you got me down

 Ex
 times
 Hang on
 Number eight
 Ex
 times
 two minus ex
 Two minus ex
 is less than or equal to
 I don't like these
 minus four
 Three times ex
 Right
 Alright
 distribute first
 P Two ex minus ex squared
 three ex minus twelve
 you get
 WH do that side
 so you get ex WH
 whoa
 Negative ex squared
 WH two ex minus XX

 plus twelve XXXX WH P
 Now do you factor this
 after you do that
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Oh but first I gotta take out that negative one
 don't
 Mhm
 I can multiply that whole side by negative one again though
 Yeah
 I have to flip that sign over if I do that
 See it's little rules like that
 that I'm not gonna remember
 So if it's a
 if it's less than or equal to
 and there's a minus
 Okay
 Are you tired
 P Not really
 I mean kind of but
 I'm gonna go home in just a few minutes
 Cause I can work on this at home

 Ouch

 Okay
 S so you say ex plus four
 is greater than or equal to zero
 P So you say
 ex is greater than or equal to
 and
 three
 Or
 Oh
 Yeah
 And if it's
 less than
 do you still do or
 No that's if it's
 in the
 those two numbers
 If there's like a
 like this one don't look
 But if there's like a
 ex in the middle

 If you have like one number on one si de
 that one's less than or equal to
 is less than or equal to ex
 less than or equal to
 less tha
 six
 Right

 So the final ans
 Right
 P Number nine P
 Okay
 I don't know this one so
 You don't know how to do this one
 So we in trouble
 Well you apparently knew how to do it
 Did I get it right
 Well you didn't get the whole thing right
 XX

 So what's that problem
 Um
 absolute value
 Okay
 of one half
 minus ex over three

 Ex over three
 oops
 Okay
 is less
 I mean is greater than or equal to
 two thirds
 Just plain old two thirds
 How do you get rid of the absolute value things
 Don't you
 I don't
 You put
 is less than or equal to two thirds
 Or is greater than
 I mean
 is greater than or equal to two thirds
 and then
 don't you have like
 i or is less than
 and is less than or equal to
 negative two thirds
 What
 Can I see what I did
 Yeah
 But when you
 when you have absolute value
 when you take the absolute value off
 and you put negative two thirds on this side
 First I'll just get a common denominator
 So I can do that
 You can't do it when it's in the absolute value
 Well I did right there
 Is that why I missed it
 But see if you wanna do that
 Just bring nega
 Just bring two thirds
 over to the other side
 And make it equal to zero
 No
 But then have
 is less than or equal to
 negative two thirds
 And that's not absolute value anymore
 Well see
 we've never done it like that

 Let me see
 If that's how you do it
 I mean I'm sure you probably can do it that way
 Cause
 in probably about as long as you have
 Oops
 WH God WH
 It's my own fault
 so long to get math over with
 I should've got it over with right out

 Oo

 A bug
 Hey Leah
 She looks so tired
 I know
 She's eating that bug

 Is that what she's doing
 I guess
 Yeah
 You can do it that way
 Mhm
 Let me see the pencil
 But then
 I guess she
 you can put it so
 WH square root of that WH
 Oh no
 See I put it in the middle
 Seven halves
 is greater than or equal to
 But you can't put it in the middle
 cause if it's gonna be g
 Yeah if it's gonna be greater than that
 Well I guess it can
 WH God WH
 So one way I could do it
 Well s
 No
 She um
 flipped that sign over
 But

 when she you divide by negative two
 which you k did
 Yeah
 it's right here
 Oh gosh
 You know what
 I'm just gonna skip this one
 No you're not
 you're gonna do it
 Now
 So I can't start by d
 Unh unh
 Not finding a common denominator
 Well I can do
 Yeah but
 why don't you p just put the other
 put
 once you have negative two thirds on the other side
 then you can find a common denom f na
 common denominator for the whole thing
 and it's gonna be the same denominat or


 I didn't mean that
 I meant once you bring it over there
 I don't ever remember us doing anything like that though
 There's like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value bars
 in problems
 Hey
 Can I use some of this
 Oh
 _Mm
 See
 yeah
 Here it's absolute values
 Right here
 And it's doing it the way that you were doing it
 I'm trying to find one like that one
 See that's the problem
 That
 I'm sitting here st worrying about this one right here
 I know
 There'll be a different one
 So what do you do
 You find a inequality
 with an absolute value in it which
 there's one right there
 Mhm
 See
 I sure didn't see any in the
 examples
 Hm m
 See
 There's no
 There it is

 See
 Here it is
 Absolute value of that
 you brought
 brought negative four over to the other side
 P Okay P
 And all that
 I know we've never done one like that
 where you do that
 Can you
 Yeah
 Th
 So if it's pointed this way
 Right
 Okay
 WH Where'd you get that one WH

 That's a big one

 You're not kidding




 Now I just get a common denominator for the whole thing
 Mhm
 Well
 take out those absolute value things
 And now this'll be six

 Is that right
 Mhm
 Now what do you do
 Subtract three
 from the middle
 And y
 To which side
 To both sides
 To both sides
 Okay

 P Negative XX P
 two ex
 Alright
 P To one
 Yeah
 Divide by
 Well just ta
 Oh
 Yeah

 And when you divide by a ne gative

 you have to flip the signs
 Okay
 And when you do that
 it's gonna be a or
 Because if you look at it
 cause
 it can't be greater than seven halves
 and less than negative halve at the sa
 So it's gonna be either ex
 is less than or equal to negative one half
 or
 Okay


 P Will you pass me some of that tea please
 Oh

 Number ten
 Twelve
 Oh good
 What did you want to do after this test
 That's it
 I guess
 You gonna study some more tomorrow then
 Oh definitely
 Okay
 Ex plus four
 over
 three ex minus two
 is less than zero
 WH Is WH less than zero
 Right

 WH Gosh WH
 Is this the c
 Are you sure we're doing work from the same class that I'm
 that I'm
 Are we
 It's got the same name
 that's about it
 Okay
 I don't even know how you start this one
 Yeah I think so
 Cause
 the way I start it
 Do I
 I left it blank
 But
 But anyways
 back to the the first thing


 I l
 Uh
 Uh I would prefer that WRITING
 that you were there on one hand
 what was felt
 rather than ha
 than create
 I don't really f find it to be
 you know
 a confrontation

 they wanna be able to just kind of figure out
 quite frankly we have more problems to resolve interior
 than we do outside of it
 Hm
 I think
 you know
 in my opinion that
 that they have to come to grips with
 the fact that they are responsible
 for basically what they've created

 You can't th penalize some body for m
 And the Vetters are somewhat responsible
 and that's
 Mhm
 Well
 That uh
 We are not the same
 the faults here
 we have to claim responsibilities
 I mean
 there's manners of of speaking that I was very outspoken about
 w that I talked to Bill and Carmela and Nancy about
 you know
 and they

 we did
 they asked me to meet with them about Teresa's thing
 Mhm

 that I find v really
 nothing
 to be honest
 nothing of any validity
 Well I
 Okay
 Unhunh

 And I told her exactly
 well
 what I know to have happ
 and I
 it's
 and I
 anyway
 we

 and and I also said
 Uh
 Well I
 Uh

 d Thank you for your l
 y what you've done for the board and so forth
 we are gonna address this letter of concerns that you've given us

 Um
 she's asked that
 you know
 she want
 You know those th

 my f
 or something like that I guess
 S they were her summar
 kyu very m very concisely
 you know
 they
 I d
 I really had a ho
 including Nancy

 M hm
 Uh had very little to to
 you know
 to agree with the validity
 Okay
 It was a matter of
 I just don't
 you know
 see where this is coming from
 It's

 Okay
 these are
 obviously in a personal issue

 Um
 she f
 you know
 I don't
 what happened happened
 But
 Well but
 My my feeling is
 as I told them
 if it's that issue
 I says
 you know
 I said let's just get real here
 I said
 I said
 Period
 Unhunh
 I don't know anybody who would even go as far as to say anything of that nature
 I said
 and
 there
 She kept saying
 prefacing everything with
 you know
 This is not a personal vendetta
 Which tells you
 that it is
 There
 there have been some
 I'll te
 if you can believe it I ha
 I know she
 there was a a
 We had a number of people once

 like half of the board
 it was a big mistake of mine
 and I know
 she felt really snubbed
 and
 and it was
 Thi this was not a w
 I invited people that helped with the market that year
 And I know
 I mean that wa really upset her
 And jeez
 Uh
 Well that's that's the thing that
 but anyway
 Donna's aware that she is not gonna be at this retreat
 but I'm gonna call her to tell her that
 you know
 Unhunh
 And what we will do
 what we're gonna probably wanna do
 d during the week
 That day

 if we have a facilitator
 Mhm
 Um
 you and Patricia and D Donna
 Mhm
 actually spend that day and just say okay
 These are the con cerns
 These were comments
 these are the ones that we feel we can address
 These are the ones that pertain to you
 Yeah

 you mentioned it yesterday
 That that there may be a number of questions
 that just cannot be answered
 Without me being there
 I I I think it's
 You know I'm gonna have
 Can we talk l

 I bet Pat's gonna
 I dropped her at the bookkeeper
 W w why don't you call me
 and we can go do that
 Cause I
 she'll be
 Ji Jim and I are gonna have lunch
 Uh
 I don't want to get her

 Sure
 Yeah
 um
 you wanna do it
 where
 what's the
 I
 I don't
 I think
 what I wanna do
 is
 my my point of wanting to push this retreat
 to do it to e
 to make it sound like we're taking it seriously
 Oh yeah
 But to also put into perspective
 I did not
 wasn't really in support of one
 I wanna make it sound important
 I want
 but it's also say
 things aren't that bad
 No
 and that what
 I
 what we
 even what Ray's attitude with with Barbara
 Mhm
 is completely unheard of
 you know and I'm
 I just couldn't be lieve that
 I
 I had
 I came real close to calling Ray
 I'm just gonna blow it off
 he's off the board
 he's
 I'm not gonna give m
 we've done everything we needed to do

 Dolores was incredibly embarrassed
 by his display
 at this time in front of her
 Dolores apolo gized for Ray to him
 you know
 Yeah
 I don't know what's got in


 because
 w which we know
 that's why he was kept trying to get involved and make it sound
 like he
 and n_you know
 same old complaint
 we didn't have any complaints

 I think this is one of the first years
 that this has been so smooth
 we would have allowed him to take a break four years ago

 Yeah
 Because
 and it wasn't so much
 I said it wasn't anything that POUND you POUND did
 wasn't any thing else
 you know
 and Pat did
 I said
 which was the best thing
 I think that was the best thing to do
 Yeah
 But I think
 we need to
 we need to d establish duties
 Mhm
 And see part of what we decided with these duties is
 just deciding
 what we need to do what
 You know

 As specific ally as we ca

 See and I'm I'm
 on one hand I'd like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes
 Pat does that
 I know
 There's
 really the secretary serves almost no function
 There signs
 in the last f y
 Right Phil
 Well
 That was it
 That was it
 That um
 I
 You know
 and if she really wants to do it
 I'm not gonna dissuade her from doing it
 But one thing we have to be careful of
 that I mentioned to Jim
 Yeah
 Which is to be careful about saying things
 In interjecting too much
 Yes

 I mean
 To to speak what she wants
 But

 No
 But that's
 you know
 I've just seen some of the looks
 from some of the people
 And whether
 I think we have to be careful
 Mhm
 Well Phil
 I mean that goes
 where that came in
 It
 Yeah
 It
 You
 you've been much more re sponsive in this sense
 Okay
 Pat's more opinionated in that sense
 You know I
 I
 what I try to do
 is is is just respond to question

 That's fine
 That
 But
 See but that
 your
 your position is different
 Okay
 That's
 Yours is in a
 is a much more official capacity

 And you are th can voice an opinion about things

 where I thought it was an issue
 during the annual meeting
 Oh
 When we brought up the thing
 Was Pat
 I
 I wasn't there
 and she was saying
 Well
 Yeah
 I didn't wanna em barrass her
 She shouldn't have done that
 people kinda going
 That was out
 Yeah

 She shouldn't've been in on that at all
 you know
 and if she wants
 you know
 basically the thing is
 But see I'm afraid we're gonna lose Jim because of that
 he feels there's a conflict
 And
 I mean he says
 There's no question about it
 Maybe it s it is gonna be right
 You know
 Well he
 d
 I mean he doesn't seem to
 you've talked to him and I've talked to him and
 Well
 he seems to be
 I mean he says mayb
 But not
 Well I a
 you know
 Yeah
 I said right now we have
 You know
 four new board members
 Or five
 You know
 Yeah
 Four new board
 yeah
 And
 we're at this point of saying okay
 All of a sudden
 we have t all these
 you know
 and we have this commitment of time
 Uh
 and but they don't know
 in the last years
 They need to be educated as to
 See this
 no
 Because
 I mean I realized
 that I'd never seen the bylaws
 since I was on the board until I asked for a copy
 Yeah
 Now what I
 what I have done though
 you know
 any new board member that jumps on
 copies of the
 because
 I wanna
 Yeah
 I wanna get these books
 but ty
 typically they no one reads em
 You know
 But it's
 At least they've got
 I'm gonna
 Mhm
 To new board members
 you know
 board members
 we need to find out what it is we're doing
 Yeah
 Whe ther we're doing something right or not

 Right
 B but
 Sure we are

 I don't
 I need to b
 them to kind of commit
 To to being responsible
 Yeah
 And
 I mean I kinda hate to feel like I'm taking charge
 but th I guess that's what I'm I'm needing to do
 Well yeah for
 y y you do
 and you're
 and that's kind of why I'm
 I'm going to assign things
 and we're gonna have
 you know
 Mhm
 b people
 that'll be given tasks
 Like
 I didn't need to do all this calling aro to find a r a r retreat space
 if I don't do it
 it's gonna fall on you or pat
 Yeah
 Of course
 Yeah

 And normally that's that's what happens
 That's okay

 I I'm a I'm a
 You know
 and Pat's doing things so
 I'd better let you go get her
 I know
 yeah
 There

 If we can go ahead and carry on
 at some point
 Because
 is the
 well the question of meeting quarterly
 is that enough
 Meaning having
 you know the
 It would be enough if committees were to meet

 and that's the
 but
 that
 that's
 that was Paul's desire
 And I think
 was
 that's what we wanna talk ab
 is quarterly
 you know
 do we need t

 as a full board every oth
 w
 uh
 but these committees need to be active
 and to do their things


 Yeah
 They need to become somewhat self sufficient
 Collections committee

 you know
 I would like to create collections committee to be something where we're almost matching
 Yeah
 Funds they can raise maybe
 Unhunh
 Yeah

 and have some
 I mean realistically
 Right
 For them to
 Mhm
 Okay we need to be responsible with this
 so that collections
 and publications will be all fund raising too


 that's
 that's where
 Because that's

 we have one board opening
 And I
 we may think about Gail
 Well Gail is very interested
 and so is this
 Hm
 Yeah I know
 Jack and I and Jim met with him
 Oh
 Jack's financial friend that
 is retired
 He's a banker
 and he'd be good on one hand
 But
 ideally XX I'd want em both
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And
 I'm hoping
 Yeah I
 what I'm gonna
 what I'm anticipating doing is
 this retreat might urge people to say
 And so I'm getting
 And it might just f get like Nancy and Kay
 I mean I like Kay XX
 See Nancy was going off
 She
 And she

 and Kay convinced
 said well Nancy you can't leave right away
 and

 she said okay
 But
 I don't know why

 and
 and then we can
 why
 tha
 At the board retreat
 I think it is
 basically
 people here

 That's right
 You know
 and
 there's a point
 Unhunh
 XXX
 I'm
 I
 I'm full agreement
 You know
 I've a greed to do this term
 Mhm
 but
 Mhm
 for a year off
 You know
 but
 You know
 Yeah
 I know
 whether or not he would volunteer
 at the marketing center
 Yeah
 I mean there's
 j
 but
 the lun

 We're gonna meet here
 Oh you're gonna have x
 Oh
 so you're not
 Okay
 Alright
 XXX
 Sam has been
 has taken such an interest in this retirement bit
 That it
 it really surprises me
 Well she's begun to listen
 Yes she has


 she used to go over and read a book
 (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)_Yeah or

 But
 once you understand it
 you know you
 I really oughta call
 and ask if
 he's still speaking to me

 Well now he was the one that was up on the left
 Up there
 Yeah
 Well
 But a anyway
 um
 I was so glad that he opened up on this disclosure bit
 because it was POUND Burns that's been ob jecting to our having it POUND
 Oh
 And I knew this
 So when he opened up on that
 you know

 but at least she wasn't disapproving
 Yeah
 of it
 And
 course Duvall might
 And I
 I cannot get over this
 That man
 I really cannot
 And you know
 he must have been thinking
 when he said he wasn't a political appointee
 he must have been associating his relationship with Steit ler
 Oh
 I really do believe that
 In his thinking
 I don't know how else he could have done it
 That topples over
 Um

 but he didn't say that
 Oh
 He said I loved your hum humor

 and I love you
 but
 Q I am not a political appointee Q


 Well he said
 I got a letter from the gover nor asking

 Every body on there is an app political appointee

 that wasn't the point

 I could have mentioned what was in the paper about him
 you know
 And I just said
 and there's Doctor Duvall
 you know


 And then I went to Rotus
 who's a seasoned pol itician
 if there ever was one
 he just would flare
 And I said
 well I
 And I'm gonna make hay out of it


 SM I wanna know how you birds got on that board
 if you're not SM political app ointees



 Oh my
 Can I grow some basil
 From seed
 Yes
 that's how I've
 I don't have any this year
 Well
 Soon as the b

 Yeah I
 it's gone
 I l
 one time the
 Uh huh
 Well I think it was Barbara that has some seeds
 Just
 Yeah
 Isn't that what you gave the neighbor one time
 I
 You gave him some kind of herb
 Did I give him some
 I gave him a red pepper
 I think you
 I think you gave him some herb of some kind
 I don't have any this year
 I have oregano
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I have a lot of dried or oregano

 Is your cigarette out
 everybody's
 Yeah
 You smoked it down into the cork
 Pardon
 You smoked it down into the cork
 Well
 Do you but
 No
 It's

 Oh

 No good
 No good
 Uh

 how's Ted doing
 He's keeping very busy
 he's on mostly evening hours
 Mhm
 they're redoing the pharmacy there at Wel Wallmart
 Enlarging it
 And
 Well
 and so the fellows in the garden shop
 have to move things out from that area
 so they can work on the pharmacy
 Well they needed to expand the pharmacy
 what I had to wait and wait and wait
 So I don't
 Where are they putting the pharma cy
 Well they're b leaving it in the same place
 they're just taking out two rows of
 of
 S
 where the toiletries were
 Yeah
 Just inventory stuff
 Moving it
 They're
 Hm

 But Ted says there's not much garden left
 all of this stuff
 out in there
 he works six days next week
 instead of five days

 M hm
 Mhm
 And
 Well
 he's been working evening hours and weekends
 you know
 I think I'd hate to be in business right now
 Oo
 You can't sit still
 Hm m
 You have to expand
 or something

 to keep MRC in the main stream MRC
 Well
 they've expanded
 Yeah
 But this Wallmart needs
 needs a larger building
 Yeah
 It's just too cramped
 Your shirt and beads are most becoming
 Well you know
 And that's the right kind of beads
 for summer
 A little girl the other day
 remarked about them
 almost on impulse
 but I didn't do it
 I thought I'd pull em off

 Q these are the only summer beads I have Q
 And I like
 I like that b shirt
 You know what I had to do
 This
 What did you
 this
 See where I sewed right down the middle of that
 Yeah
 Otherwise it would balloon out
 And so I s
 put it on the machine

 So it d doesn't gap
 Right
 Oh
 Yeah
 Well it works

 It had a
 it had a
 one of those bottoms that
 Oh
 are
 what do you call it
 A tail
 No
 It the band
 I don't either
 Makes your butt look thin
 Makes your hei
 I went over to a store
 where it says

 sewing
 alterations
 And all that stuff
 And I said
 for taking that bottom band off the top
 you know
 And just making it a straight shirt
 And she said
 THUMP Q eight dollars Q
 And I thought


 that's a little like these catalog things
 I saw something in a cat
 the catalog
 I've been with for a long time
 I wanted to buy it
 It was a m
 Mhm
 Didn't you notice em
 all beautiful colors
 So pretty
 Well anyway
 And
 I wanted to order that muumuu
 I mean it was around twenty nine dollars
 and two pairs of short pajamas
 One for Sam
 And
 I looked at the postage attached to it

 and I thought good heavens
 It's by amounts of POUND money
 Not weight
 How much money this costs
 And it's geared according to that POUND
 And I thought
 forget it
 and buy another whole outfit
 Yeah
 you know
 Uh
 I like to get pillow covers
 That you zip on
 to protect the pillows
 Mhm
 And
 I went over to Sears
 one time
 Through the catalog
 And instead of sending it in with a shipment or anything
 I paid postage on it separate
 Yeah
 And do you know the postage came to more
 Than the g
 more than the product
 Right

 Well I
 I w
 That's one of the letters that I'm going to write to USPE
 And just tell them
 That they're gearing this in the wrong way
 It should be geared according to weight
 Now
 That g cotton
 two pairs of cotton pajamas
 and that cotton muumuu
 ain't gonna weigh up to eight dollars worth
 Believe you me
 So
 I thought th
 I just won't order from em
 I m
 That's foolish
 We better go up to Dillards
 You mean up to Phoenix
 No
 I don't know
 They
 Pretty c
 pretty colors
 Some of em were dark
 oh
 purples and
 reds and
 pinks and

 You didn't see em
 I don't think I was
 I was
 I think I was concerned about your getting there and back


 You're not the only one baby


 I was just dripping
 I was just soaked
 I was just absolutely soaked
 Wasn't I
 Yeah
 She c came in
 the first ten or fif teen min utes

 stopping the flow of
 trickling down her neck

 Oh terrible
 Just terrible
 Oh well


 I
 My other Doris does the same thing
 Oh does she
 Well what is it
 I don't know
 Well some people just perspire
 Well I didn't persp use to perspire like that
 more
 but I sure have done it
 no
 recently
 Th that
 and the time we were up in
 M Montgomery Wards
 That was just
 weakness
 Exertion
 Well maybe that's what this was
 But anyway
 I wish the stores would open earlier
 Yes
 I do too
 Well it would he
 it would help
 you hate to start out at ten o' clock
 and quit at four

 You know the little folks who live above me
 go over to Tucson Mall
 That's good
 Mhm
 Unlocked
 oh I think
 They go r uh at least by eight o'clock
 Yeah
 And they go in
 and then they know
 so many times around
 Mhm
 will
 make a mile
 And then there's a
 soft drink place up there that they all congregate

 And
 Why don't you join em
 and they have pins
 when they cover fifty miles

 No
 no
 it's a
 It's just people around in that area
 it's ne
 and they go there to walk

 I think that's it
 But
 I

 and all they're doing is just walking
 Mhm
 They might be good people
 we could cultivate to hunt things for us


 You mean look in the window
 Now that's


 Instead of having to parade all around looking for it

 they're around
 Of cour se



 Right





 let me pay a little fee
 call em every morning
 that I'm up and around
 What what what w
 Back up a minute
 I
 You'll pay to be called
 and a
 and clients will call in and say

 And so th
 they're through for the day then
 I'm up
 If I don't call in by say nine o'clock
 Then
 well I'll be glad to do that for a fee
 You will




 Angela
 I don't m
 it
 does that b
 I'd like to have somebody I could call in to
 every morning

 or I call in
 I call in and let you
 whoever it is
 know I'm up
 Well
 We're up
 You can do it with
 you can do that with us
 sometimes we're up at four o'clock



 Well
 You will
 Yeah
 It's on a bus iness basis right now
 We just formed a corporation
 I'll


 and

 w w we're in business
 Should we have an attorney to advise us
 Oh




 Oh

 What else were you cooking in there
 Just the bread pudding
 I made
 bean salad for us for lunch
 Oh you did
 You like beans
 Onions in it
 Oh yes
 (H)Le
 And egg
 I've found out
 that I can enhance
 various dishes that I cook
 if I use my onion powder and garlic powder
 Not the onion salt
 but the
 the onion powder
 Yeah
 And I've
 Other day

 and I put some onion powder in the mayonnaise
 and put it on some boiled eggs
 Opened em up
 and I didn't stuff the eggs
 I just put that mayonnaise on top
 And they said
 Yeah
 So remember
 I don't have any on ion powder
 I have garlic powder
 You can find it in Wallgreens
 There about
 Yeah I
 Well

 Oh you've been telling me that all along
 But he
 I don't think the man knows what he's about
 I mean you know
 A aren't you going to see him soon
 Again
 I just saw him
 and then in two months

 an ray
 ray
 Heart
 Really

 Well is the do
 We should get a
 a paper today
 They were gonna send a copy
 Uh
 that
 Excuse me


 He said
 take the

 The water pill
 Diarrhetic
 Take one of the capsules
 Las Lazex
 Or something like
 Lazix
 but I'll be taking the generic drug
 Of it
 In the morning
 Then in the afternoon
 take the capsule and one one Lazik

 She did that yesterday
 My stomach gives me trouble
 I cramp

 Well what

 Are are you eating Tums
 for calcium
 I'm not eating Tums

 I have
 Oh I did take
 I did s
 call out last night
 make a note for potassium though
 Do you have one of those little things that has a compartment in it for each day
 No
 Heaven sakes

 I'm not a very good pill taker
 I'm re
 I think I'm resenting
 but I have
 I'm re senting this medicine
 I think that the cardazam is
 I think that the d diarrhetic is

 Well now your
 Now look at em
 Now they're s tight again
 Oh
 No
 that

 that the spring broke in my recli ner
 And Dorsen's fixed it
 You got it fixed up
 And

 And they found out
 that
 it was easier
 they went back out the truck
 and got a g
 a whole assembly
 The the the
 Mhm
 You know
 Makes the XX
 The the the f
 the footrest goes out
 You know there's a
 a a mechanism there
 So they put a whole new mechanism in on side
 Hm
 And I wasn't prepared for them to

 I was going to tip them
 but I wasn't prepared
 To b buy the chair
 Over again

 S so

 Well that was enough
 I XX
 They're on salary with the c
 with the company any way

 But they were so jovial
 and
 nice
 Now
 a tight little spring
 that
 governed the mechanism
 And held the chair together
 when you put out
 Oh
 the foot rest
 And I told
 Well I think I told you this
 I phoned her and said
 I don't know whether I can sit in the chair at all or not
 And I said
 and besides

 And
 and she
 sh she said
 well it's alright to sit on it
 but don't put the footrest out

 How are we on the


 I can't tell when it's done

 It looks like it's done
 Oh honey no
 It goes for forty five minutes
 Well the
 It's not the
 when that's empty

 Well
 maybe we've talked for forty five minutes
 I don't know whether it's to go off
 Does it automatically go off at the end of
 Yeah
 well that's what
 Oh
 Why sure
 Are you rea dy
 Y

 Whatever
 Politics deals with the question of power
 That's the introduction to empowerment
 What is power
 Very quickly
 all of you should know these two concepts
 they're not that difficult
 What is power
 Having the capacity to impact public policy
 So if we're talking about politics
 And if we're talking about empowerment as a concept
 we must have an understanding of the notion of what is power
 Now does power come in one form
 Different
 Different forms
 Back here
 What forms
 Give me examples of power
 Either one of you


 Education
 know ledge
 knowledge
 Okay
 what else
 Um
 um
 your position in the workforce
 Um
 I'm trying to think of the word
 Close
 num bers
 right
 What else
 Social status
 Social status
 position
 right
 If you're the chairperson of um a major corporation
 would you say that that person has some power
 Most definitely
 Alright
 Especially if you're in IBM
 or Chrysler Corporation and
 some t_ __
 some examples
 gender and race
 can give you power
 Gender race
 Alright
 Gender race
 Let's talk about race
 in terms of power
 If I make the statement which I did
 that there's no fear factor
 when it comes to the Chicano_Latino community
 and there is much more of a fear factor
 in dealing with the African_American community
 am I not dealing with a racial factor of power
 WH Yes WH
 Because it's gonna affect
 the decision making process
 the politics
 and
 the policy
 Africa_ __
 i_ __
 Kinda like in past
 African_Americans have been more organized
 and have had more leaders
 or not more leaders
 That's right
 Alright
 Mhm
 I mean
 if one looks at what

 vis a vis who
 The major league
 Baseball teams and all that
 Football and all that
 What's his underlying argument
 What's his criticism
 That there're not sufficient numbers of what
 Blacks
 Well he says minorities
 He's smart
 In the
 managerial process of
 of professional sports
 Managerial
 owners
 managers
 Alright
 Have you heard of a Latino say this
 Or would a XXX Jesse Jackson have said that about Latinos
 Hm
 No
 Unh_unh
 And we're gonna get into that
 in our discussion
 Alright
 So
 the whole notion of power is very important to understand
 Some generalities that some people would say are not true
 I mean how can Doctor Montoya say that Latinos have no
 they have two people that are cabinet members
 they have supervisor here in Los Angeles
 Well power is relative as well
 It's relative
 Power is relational
 How can you measure power
 Power is impossible to measure
 Alright
 In other words
 various ingredients
 and say
 A
 B
 C
 D
 We can make generalities
 Position
 Wealth
 All these different things that I've talked about
 But power is difficult to measure
 So that
 we must deal with the whole question of empowerment
 from also the perspective of potential power versus actual power
 There is a difference
 If I am
 for example
 the president of a major labor union
 or a major corporation
 the position
 as president of that entity
 gives me so much power
 But yet if I do not know how to utilize
 that entity in terms of its mobilization
 for a given objective
 like a labor union
 If I have fourteen million people as members
 and I don't show any manifestation of power
 Well
 it has to be measured by what you're trying to do
 Example
 Labor today
 is being challenged by perhaps one of the most serious pieces of __
 not legislation per se
 but
 a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement
 that if passed by Congress
 is going to impact three economies
 Canada
 U S
 and Mexico
 Labor
 is going to be the most impacted
 How is labor today mobilizing its great power
 Uh not just the AFL_CIO and its fourteen million members
 but the United Auto Workers
 and many other or_ labor organizations
 what are they doing
 to influence public policy
 Combining power
 Huh
 They're combining their power
 How are they combining their power
 By al_ allying with other

 unions of workers
 among themselves
 Cause environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted
 especially along the border
 Alright
 so there's_
 there's a lot of coalition building
 But can you say as a historian
 that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago
 Taking to the streets
 Alright
 good point
 They have __
 He said
 they have lost power
 So your measurement of a loss of power is based on what
 What they can and can't XX
 Alright
 You don't see
 what you've read about
 right
 Right
 today
 Alright
 That's one perception
 Is the Black community less powerful today
 in nineteen_ninety_three
 in nineteen sixty eight
 with the poor people's march on Washington
 or nineteen_sixty_three
 again
 on the w_ march to Washington
 on Washington
 when Martin Luther King gave his famous speech
 There were three hundred thousand people
 at that march in nineteen_sixty_three
 Which period of time
 was a time where Blacks were manifesting much more power
 Today
 or nineteen_sixty_three
 When
 When they m_ manifest
 When
 When do
 make a comparison nineteen_ninety_three
 nineteen_sixty_eight
 nineteen_sixty_three
 during those three periods
 when
 would you say
 Blacks demonstrated much more power
 Now
 They have more power now
 They have more power
 Why do you say that
 Cause they're more recognized
 I mean
 Does recognition give you power
 Hm
 P Yeah P
 To a_ __
 To some aspects
 I think
 I think the __
 Ah
 Explain that
 You have
 you have African_Americans more institutionalized
 in our system now
 Ah
 than they were in six ty_eight
 Today
 they have how many Congressmen
 Thirty eight
 Thirty eight congressional representatives
 I don't know how many they had in nineteen_sixty_three
 but probably no more than two or three if they were lucky
 Alright
 Would you say that
 I would say that's right
 Go on
 What else
 In sixty_eight
 the Blacks were a whole lot more mobile
 mobilized
 Much better mobilized
 three_hundred_thousand marching on Washington
 is an example
 You probably couldn't get that today
 Alright

 You know with Chicanos
 During the era of the Vietnam War
 Twenty_five_thousand Chicanos were mobilized in Los Angeles
 a_ at the national Chicano moratorium against the war
 No one
 has come even close
 With the exception of the death of Cesar Chavez recently
 where there were approximately forty_thousand people
 to mobilize
 large numbers of people
 into some kind of a effort or movement
 Alright
 So he's correct
 It depends on the time
 depends on the circumstances
 and the form of power
 Institutionalized power is different from
 the unconventional form that y_ you just described
 Well what we're trying to get at
 is potential versus actual
 My argument
 as humble as it is
 is that Chicanos
 in nineteen_ninety_three
 are fast developing
 a high potential for power
 but they're a long way from actualizing their true power
 Okay
 they're_ we're still at the potential phase of our empowerment
 and not at the actual power phase
 Alright
 Anything else
 On those two concepts
 Alright
 Let's get into discussion on voter participation
 I don't have the time to give you a lot of statistics
 but I'll give you some
 general trends
 some statistical information
 that will prove a point
 that will introduce the subject of political participation
 in the United States
 Now
 the participation of the citizenry is imperative
 It is absolutely imperative
 if it's to be a democracy
 Now what am I trying to say
 What am I trying to say
 It is imperative for the people to participate
 in the political process
 Another way of saying it
 What am I saying
 We have to vote
 everyone
 But why is it important
 in a democracy for the people to participate
 Just deal with the question
 Not the methods
 You mean because if the people don't vote
 it will be
 there will be an elite group
 it'll be more of a monarchy
 that has control
 it won't be a democracy
 Kings
 Well one __
 What
 or one family
 Alright
 Close
 There's a royal type of family right
 king
 not elected
 alright
 hereditary
 alright
 But what am I getting at
 W_ what's the essence of what I'm asking for
 Yes
 Fire away
 By its very nature
 democracy demands voting
 Stop right there
 You made a statement
 What is a democracy
 Democracy is rule by the people
 Alright
 L Demos cratos L
 People rule
 The Greeks were major contributors to this political process of development
 of concepts
 L Demos cratos L
 People govern
 Alright
 We tell the world
 that democracy is what we practice
 Is that what we tell the world
 Yeah
 Alright
 Would you agree with that
 Okay
 What else do we say
 selling our political system
 In selling our political system
 we make it synonymous
 synonymous by saying that
 we don't distinguish
 the form of economic system
 versus the political system
 and that we put it in the same kettle
 Democracy
 and capitalism
 are essentially the same
 Are they the same
 No
 No
 But yet we do
 And
 if we listen carefully
 and read carefully
 all these books on international relations
 foreign relations and so forth
 what is it that we tell the world
 that America is
 The cradle of democracy
 We are the cradle of democracy
 we are the bastion of the free world
 et cetera et cetera et cetera
 And when Ronald Reagan was in power
 we talked about the evil empire
 Categorizing

 and the so_called Communist empire
 Alright
 I say this because
 there is
 a tendency for some of us to believe
 we have been conditioned
 Who conditions us to think the way we think
 What did we deci_ __
 What did we say
 earlier
 talking about culture
 Um
 they learn through schools
 through their families
 Schools
 The media
 Everything else
 I mean
 doesn't the media tell us that there's only a two_party system in this country
 Mhm
 Mhm
 that the Communist Party
 all these parties that we have
 supposedly minority parties
 don't get the same kind of treatment
 as the Democratic and Republican parties
 They're not mainstream
 We have a two party system
 We are taught from the very beginning that there's only two parties
 That's a l different subject
 But I'm
 What I'm
 if we look into the realities
 of what we have as a political system
 we tell the world
 a supreme court
 we have a presidency
 we have a political system
 governed by certain principles
 and laws
 that emanate from what
 The Constitution
 which is a living document
 That is very much the document that protects
 conceptually and otherwise
 our way of life
 Our democracy and so forth
 Well
 if we remember our Chicano history
 my point
 it's difficult
 for us as Chicanos
 as we get into it
 to understand
 why is it
 including ourselves
 because a lot of Chicanos don't even understand why we don't vote
 why don't we participate
 and they come up with all kinds of somewhat superficial analysis
 that
 much of our political behavior
 is a product of what was covered in this class
 under history
 and culture
 Two
 major currents
 of history
 two major currents of political culture
 right
 I'll get back to that concept
 But just general terms
 What is political culture
 What is political culture
 Alright
 I want you to think
 because you're gonna
 It's very important that you understand that concept
 But I want
 Thing I want to underline here
 is that
 we are products
 of a historical
 dualistic process
 Mexico's history
 we're a pr
 A cultural process
 and American
 Whatever American means
 So those two major ingredients
 have molded
 that I'm using in this class
 to explain
 why is it
 that we're still
 at the potential phase of empowerment
 and we still
 have a long ways to go
 before we realize
 that concept that I describe
 called empowerment
 But before we get into that s substance of that
 is that
 I wanna just briefly cover
 that
 even though
 I'm saying that
 Chicanos do not vote in great numbers
 And we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers
 The fact is
 as I mentioned earlier
 that even though we tell the world
 we are this beacon of light
 of freedom
 of liberty
 justice
 by and large
 not a lot of people participate politically across the board
 I don't care if you're African American
 I don't care if you're Asian American
 and I don't care if you're Latino
 Most Americans
 do not vote
 in great numbers
 So
 it's a double whammy
 Introducing the subject matter here
 Americans
 in comparison to France
 in comparison to Germany
 in comparison to Italy
 we don't vote
 in the numbers that they do
 Alright
 I mean
 Italy for example
 has a voter turnout
 of ninety percent
 Of those that are eligible to vote
 we're lucky if we get fifty percent
 Are we less democratic
 Are they more democratic
 Why is it that Italy has
 a much larger
 a higher voter level of participation
 Or Germany
 Or even Canada
 Seventy percent
 The fact is
 that democracy in this country is dying
 I want you to put that down
 Cause it's gonna be important
 At least for my analysis
 you have plenty of time
 One week to think about it
 American democracy is dying
 I want you to put that whole phrase in black and white
 American democracy is dying
 and I want you to try to think of why
 As we get into the discussion of Chicano participation
 And we'll get back to that statement next week
 So
 for us
 That's another point I wanna underscore
 Because if the larger general population doesn't vote in great numbers
 when you're at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole
 you're at the very bottom
 with all the problems of poverty
 and all the social problems that we're
 we've been talking about
 it's understandable why
 perhaps
 Chicanos do not vote
 or participate in great numbers
 Now
 the literature
 in political science
 dealing with
 factors influence
 influencing voting
 are many
 Are many
 Civic Culture
 Almond and Verba
 nineteen seventy two or so
 is one book that you can look at
 um
 there's a book by Raymond Wolfinger
 Steven Ronsteen Ronstone I'm sorry
 Who Votes
 that's another book
 Okay
 the literature goes on and on
 But all I want to do
 in terms of just giving you some idea
 of what are the factors that influence
 And there are essentially five
 You can probably develop more
 these are general categories
 Most of the literature in political science
 and I think Mister Verba would agree with me on this
 that
 people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty
 What does that mean
 A sense of duty
 They regard participation as important
 Now
 why would you say
 that this is a factor that influences voting
 Now this is a very somewhat altruistic
 value
 A sense of duty
 Why
 Why would you say
 that people in this country have a
 Some people that vote
 vote because they have a sense of duty
 Why
 Right here
 I don't know
 probably it stems mostly from
 your education
 you're an American citizen
 you know
 towards other people and
 to vote
 Because without you
 then y we won't have government
 Same sense of jury duty
 Jury
 Good point
 duty
 As we go through some of these
 these five
 I want you to think of the agents of socialization
 Because then I want you to think
 how do those agents affect us as Chicanos
 number one
 Who is responsible for inculcating that sense of duty
 One
 the family
 Alright
 Remember
 The family is your primary agent
 Two
 the educational institutions
 I mean
 from the time that you start kindergarten
 to the time that you graduate from the university
 it's constant
 not constant
 but somewhat of a consistent bombardment of values
 attitudes
 reinforcing the nature of the political system
 and the virtues of participating in the political process
 So in essence
 Yes
 I think that it's more eye opening
 to see
 that
 this doesn't exist
 more than it does
 And that's why people don't vote
 It seems that
 I mean you talk to people
 they have an attitude
 I can't make a difference
 That's why I don't vote
 It's not my responsibility
 There's not a sense of duty
 Even though
 like you said
 from the beginning
 supposedly we're getting it all through school
 And this is a much
 of a recent phenomena
 much more
 Because you've had
 declining voter participation levels
 And I'm giving you the answer
 Wa what what what has been the problem
 Contributing to what you just said
 Well
 I agree
 I think m maybe one of the reasons could be
 they're not being represented
 they don't

 see any like direct results for them
 you know
 the government
 and who's in control
 Okay
 I think I
 I n
 That's
 Sure
 alright
 I mean
 That's
 Would you agree with that
 Mhm
 they vote their pocketbook
 They
 They're
 They vote definitely their pocketbook
 That's true
 What would you add to f

 Well
 you say we're not represented
 between
 say like the last

 you know
 you voted for Clinton or
 you know
 you know
 whatever his name was





 No
 I don't think
 I don't think there's as much trust
 XX
 Why
 I mean you had Nixon
 to Watergate
 Now l let's talk about that
 What what did
 What did
 You
 in the beginning
 well even in the late sixties you had Vietnam
 you had
 Excellent
 What did Vietnam do
 Turned
 the youth especially
 against the government policies
 the educated youth
 More so
 and those were
 I think
 the people that were gonna be voting
 as they went on
 Alright
 On that score
 would you say that most of you

 of the sixties
 All of you were born in the sixties
 Early seventies
 Right
 So that means that most of your parents

 were very much a part of the era of the sixties
 Alright
 go back to you
 that your parents were very much influenced by the Vietnam war
 One way or the other
 Yeah
 Which
 Which way
 Which direction
 total apathy
 Total apa thy
 Why
 Um
 well my mom
 Total apathy
 She just
 I th
 I don't know
 I think she just got burned out
 you know
 and seeing another corrupt man
 you know
 another scandal breaking out
 She knew friends that were dying in Viet
 you know
 She had friends that were drafted
 were dying
 you know
 she just didn't care anymore
 I think it was just a lot of negatives had built up
 and she just let it go
 Okay
 How about your parents
 Um
 well my dad was drafted
 He was in Vietnam
 Um
 long story

 Alright
 yeah
 My mom claims she was too young to know
 I don't know
 Um
 I don't know how my dad really felt about it
 I know
 we come from a long line of military men
 so he kind of felt a sense of duty
 so

 Was there a sense of betrayal
 Possibly

 Who else
 Who wants
 about what we're trying to say
 It's the best
 Why do these cans
 get so warped
 Only the
 Only the Sam's Club cans get so warped

 I think you should write
 Cause they're X
 Just write a letter to em
 that's why
 What I'm gonna complain about
 It's like sparkling grape juice cocktail
 you know
 Remember that white
 They only make that with Nutrasweet though
 do
 don't they
 They don't make a regular
 A regular grape

 Every time I've looked at the bot that bottled water
 or the sparkling water
 it's all with
 I couldn't find it last time I was in there

 So
 I don't know what the real story is
 it sounded kinda neat

 Okay
 One large loan
 renewed
 a hundred ninety seven thousand
 It's on Gerald and Pamela
 O kay
 no problem
 He's handled his line of credit as agreed
 so it's pretty routine
 Joe
 P Okay P
 First loan request I have
 that will be refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae
 Customer is Gerry and Pamela Tucker
 at sixty one fifty eight Main Street
 they're requesting eighty four thousand dollars
 this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal
 title work
 and points
 Eighty four
 Eighty four even

 Their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance
 would be seven sixty one eighty nine
 based at the current thirty year rate
 They estimate the value of their home to be
 one hundred and ten thousand dollars
 We had an appraisal in nineteen ninety one
 that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars
 Eighty percent of that would make it eighty two four
 um
 in order to make them a loan for eighty four thousand
 will determine whether or not we can go the full eighty four
 and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket
 Their assets total one sixteen four seventeen
 their liabilities eighty three
 their net worth thirty one
 So all they owe is the house

 They

 and after the refinance
 they would have a debt to income of fifteen over twenty three

 I missed that
 They're fifteen over
 No
 They're currently twenty
 They can't be
 ove r twenty seven
 I
 Oh
 Twenty
 Twenty over twenty seven
 Yeah
 You can't even
 Twenty over tw
 I couldn't even read my f

 It's twenty over twenty seven
 What is acceptable pretty much

 what figures
 Twenty eight over thirty six is the maxe s
 so they're well within
 Okay
 I just wondered
 They're well within their debt to income
 I always heard the figures
 Um
 So you said they're gonna be fifteen
 Mhm
 Fifteen over twenty three so
 their debt to income isn't a problem
 the

 problem as I see it is
 the value of the house
 and the second matter at hand is
 in nineteen eighty seven
 they had filed a chapter eleven
 They had at the time a mortgage with us
 They reaffirmed on that mortgage
 They were never late
 We

 After that discharge
 we even advanced them money to purchase this house
 on Main st Street here in Hillsdale
 and
 they have never missed a payment on that loan
 I've also made them car loans
 that they've never missed a payment on
 and
 as long as they have been discharged
 at least two years
 and reestablished and paid as agreed
 their credit obligations
 With that in mind
 um
 I am moving
 that they app

 subject to a certified appraisal of their home
 Do we have the discharge
 Yes
 I have a copy of it
 It was discharged on
 November
 no
 Two twenty three eighty eight
 Discharge date was two twenty three of eighty eight
 When did they file
 In eleven
 Mhm
 Three months
 That's pretty fast

 It was a business
 No

 it was pretty cut and dried

 debt
 and apparently nobody objected to the
 the bankruptcy
 Since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors
 All the debt that was charged
 that was bank filed bankruptcy against was unsecured creditors
 And they discharged em
 Yeah
 in a three mon
 No I
 I just
 it's unusual that they don't require em to
 See
 the from what I I gathered is the
 unsecured creditors got nothing
 and the secured creditors
 just carried on their payment history as agreed
 As originally set forth in their contracts
 But you know usually the plan'll provide some period of time of protection
 Oh I
 Mhm
 But if we've got
 Yeah
 But if we've got the discharge
 Yeah
 Well
 notice of joint
 discharge of joint debtors
 it
 it appears the persons named above
 commencing
 Yeah
 joint case under title eleven
 on November twenty third
 And that an order of relief has been entered
 no complaint objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed
 within the time fixed by the court
 Uh
 Ten minutes
 Or


 And
 and that they're
 Hell we can't even get to court in three months

 That
 I have a lean
 nineteen eighty eight
 Okay

 That's all
 I just
 Yeah
 That's what I was just
 I assumed it would've been
 like eighty
 ninety two or something
 What
 the five
 What actually happened to them
 was
 she opened a franchise
 And it was
 a franchise of doing packaging

 from a mall basis

 gift wrapping
 and ship ping
 They should have gotten into the business
 and then they would've had a Christmas season
 There was a t
 It got to be real complicated
 and they didn't get in until February
 Well February they had nothing to do and
 and I think they
 They hung in there for a year and a half
 And they just couldn't
 couldn't see end to it
 XX

 I'll s
 I'll second then Joe
 So it's moved and seconded to
 approve that loan subject to the

 appraisal by a certified appraisal
 And the max is eighty four
 Mhm
 Okay
 Okay
 All in favor aye
 Aye
 Opposed same sign
 Motion carries

 Is that the only one
 That's the only loan I have
 I got one small one
 The only reason it's in here
 is because the borrowers already have
 three hundred three thousand borrowed
 but if we
 if Jim and Kurt approve it today
 Uh
 they wanna borrow forty f
 Dave wants to borrow forty five hundred dollars to
 finish paying off the renovation
 and upgrade necessary on the daycare
 And
 he had initially thought what he borrowed would do it
 He wants to set it up on a year

 um
 you know his debt to income is relatively high
 the daycare is scheduled to open a week after the fifth
 So around the twelfth to fifteenth of January
 he thought he's been
 he thought he was already opened
 Cause there was articles in the paper
 he had his ads out and everything
 but he didn't have all the i's dotted and t's crossed
 So
 one group of state people
 the people that do all the
 do the testing for
 electrical and safety and stuff have been there
 and now the state inspector's got to come in
 I guess they just look at the quality of the facility
 Not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating
 is it clean
 They're supposed to be there the fifth
 and he said
 that it usually takes a week
 for them to send a report in
 and for their license to come back
 So
 he anticipates that they'll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth
 he gave me some numbers
 thirteen or fourteen kids they're already taking care of
 mostly out of their house
 So they fully expect income to exceed the projection
 but right now they don't have any income
 other than from his job

 XXX
 What
 And he's gonna have twenty five people
 The building is
 At l east twenty five children
 Twenty five
 See they're e
 he hopes to get up around fifty
 See they're looking at four people
 I've gone through the build ing
 and it is
 a r very very nicely done operation
 I mean there's nothing shoddy about the workmanship
 or the cleanliness of the
 of the building
 No
 They
 where he was
 where he had his
 his cabinet sh op
 shop
 And was living in it
 It's like anything
 when you're dealing with th
 you know
 they
 you know
 and they
 There's a lot of this going on
 I would move
 since it's secured for forty five hundred
 I would move that we advance the funds
 I'll second it
 Except
 they owe pretty much
 Three hundred three thousand
 and some odd dollars
 But he's always serviced
 I mean

 and they do have the income
 the income doesn't
 Well
 I say they have it
 Once the daycare gets up to twenty people
 They'll fall back under the forty percent
 Um
 but
 you know
 it it
 you know
 and his overall debt is working down
 You just
 I guess you can't say too much if they're paying on time
 Uh
 Yeah
 and
 And I think they're about to the point


 I think if th
 th th
 He's already talking
 start looking at expanding that storage facility
 It's one of those things
 I think there's
 they're always gonna have quite a bit of debt
 Cause
 you know he's
 that's kind of their
 you know he's looking at that as his retirement income
 Well it's been moved and seconded

 to approve
 but that
 we can't really disburse on that
 That
 due to his size
 of the loan
 until we have all
 They need f f
 Four
 f
 all in
 I'm voting in favor of it
 Yeah
 See I was
 So see I've got two
 I'll get hold of two more
 but he didn't
 s Dave didn't get in here until
 after he was gone
 so
 that's the only one I have
 Any other loans
 No other loans to be discussed
 I got a couple things here
 but
 we'll
 the one
 is in regard to
 the retail
 nondeposit investment
 just to kind of bring us up to speed
 m Matt has tentatively accepted our offer for employment
 but since he's going to be a dual employee
 th
 XX
 Okay
 I'll I'll c
 I'll catch up the board up to speed
 because it has some loan relevance
 Uh he was interviewed by LCL
 Larry Harb interviewed him over the telephone yesterday
 Larry called me this morning
 that's who had called about seven thirty
 Um
 what
 what we have set up is
 at LCL's office
 on
 for Monday evening
 Tuesday
 and Wednesday training
 The f
 will be very specific for him
 their workflow
 On Wednesday then
 there may be four or five other asset managers with him
 discussing sails motivations and
 and and sales approaches and strategies
 Larry said
 philosophically
 He said that's our decision
 Of which
 I you know
 I wanted Larry to tell me how he thinks he's gonna do
 you
 he should be
 So I I'm

 tho
 that looks good
 What I did
 kind of
 in regard to that
 and
 I don't have this date finalized
 s
 I'm trying to go maybe the second week of January
 to have a representative of Bankers Systems
 come THUMP here THUMP
 to do some specialized training
 within the qualified retirement plan area
 Matt needs
 Matt needs an understanding of
 not a detailed understanding
 so that he w can have
 so he understands how
 his products plug into the to the self directed IRAs
 We also
 it would do us good to know what products we can offer
 under those qualified retirement plans
 So
 R
 supposed to come down
 I haven't set up a date
 but
 he'll be here on a f
 Vivian
 and
 sometime during the day to the two of you
 Because as loan officers
 you have a good handle on borrowers and
 and can kind of tell them of these SEPs
 Uh
 we've kind of hesitated in in offering those

 well
 Offering the self directed we're getting
 we need to get a dif
 Instead of called an IRA
 it's called an IRA SD
 for self directed
 And then
 that will allow people
 to
 if they don't want all their funds in a bank CD
 as as are custodial IRA arrangements
 all those funds have to be in First National Bank of Hillsdale
 The self directed
 the the participant signs a an investment direction
 or
 where where he directs the investments
 They sign the form
 Uh
 the
 what
 the SEP has a vehicle
 has to be connected to the IRA
 So we take the SEP off the shelf
 and then if the person wants that money put into a bank CD
 then we just use our custodial IRA forms
 If they want a self directed i SEP
 you take the same SEP form off
 but you're using a different IRA
 You're not using the custodial IRA arrangement
 An SEP must have an IRA attached to it
 So that
 the IRAs all fit in the same plan
 They're just different ch boxes checked off of this overall plan
 the overall plan is what you're talking about goes back
 They
 Exactly
 So
 I I had talked with with Rick Brady today
 and
 he's gonna send me those forms
 The other
 but it's really not a cost
 it's kind of a s flip flop
 he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those self directed IRAs ourselves
 Because of how complicated the law is in all this

 I mean
 coincidentally Banker Systems offers a comprehensive account maintainance services

 Isn't that XX


 what what what we would do is
 they would take care of the account maintainance
 In a similar manner
 as they take care of the
 the other qualified plans
 Mhm
 We
 They
 We send them the information
 th
 They
 And
 and they file whatever needs to be filed
 The
 It's really not gonna cost us
 we use their eight hundred number
 and their

 fi
 their newsletter
 for the IRAs
 We don't have their comprehensive service
 And that runs about three hundred dollars a year
 If you go to the comprehensive account maintenance
 the eight hundred number is included
 and the f
 So we would drop three hundred dollars off
 The account maintenance
 comprehensive account maintenance
 maintenance would cost us five hundred dollars
 But
 what you do is
 they
 he estimates it'd be five hundred dollars
 Banker System charges thirty five dollars an account
 And he said under a self directed arrangement
 he's seen charges
 to maintain a self directed IRA
 anywhere from forty to a hundred fifty dollars
 Now I think a hundred fifty dollars is a lot
 to maintain a self directed IRA
 So you mean

 that you
 That's what you're saying
 We
 Well he he thought
 they they d talk in kind of nebulous terms
 w they
 they have a minimum number of accounts

 Oh
 with w
 is covered if you will by the five hundred
 Yes
 Okay
 way I understood it would
 let's say five hundred would would cover the eight hundred
 which is very very helpful service
 and
 the maintenance for let's say twenty accounts
 Well
 if we had ten accounts
 we would charge five hundred fifty dollars on ac on an account
 what what that would
 I think it would be good for the five or six of us
 to
 to have Galino down here
 can kind of explain what products
 we can offer from the bank side
 Hm
 and and we all need to know that
 and then
 we can figure out how Matt's
 the products that LCL's gonna offer will plug into that
 And it's
 I was thinking of sending Matt up there for a week
 but
 you know he's up there a week
 he's gonna learn a lot of very technical information
 such as like those section four fifteen XSes
 That that I was talking about
 You really don't need to know the the technical
 nitty gritty about it
 because
 that's what Bankers Systems does
 it's gonna be less expensive
 to have Galino come here
 instead of one person going up to to Minnesota for a week
 and then trying to bring back the information
 we're gonna have Galino come down here for a day
 and
 he won't
 he won't touch any specific complicated items
 Such as four fifteen XSes or
 or ACP testing or that
 Cause Vivian and I kind of know that
 but if we don't know that
 like that four fifteen XS
 I called the eight hundred number
 and and they went through the explanation
 where the IRS changed the the deduction
 Just a
 Just a question
 from a mechanics
 Who's gonna hold the account
 Is LCL gonna hold the account
 is the bank gonna ho hold the account
 Who act
 You know
 and and LCL products
 if you will
 held the account
 That that's physically where it was
 Is is it's
 I is the plan gonna be in the bank
 or is the plan just kind of nebulous
 Well
 well the the SEP and the IRA
 will will be First National Bank of Hillsdale
 Okay
 That's what I meant
 But but tho those
 if you will
 We offer those
 and then LCL
 if will have
 within that plan
 If you don't want a CD
 Tha the
 you could direct that
 that the monies be used to buy some mutual fund
 we would get the statement from LCL
 for the mutual fund holdings
 let's say the person also had a CD
 Let's
 You know
 it doesn't matter how they split it
 And then then
 what what we would have to do is
 pull that information together
 We would get LCL's statement
 as of the end of the year
 and what the balance was
 pull that in
 we would report that up to Bankers Systems
 and they would then combine that
 and produce the report
 It
 That's why there's normally a cost in those self directed
 because
 it's not
 with our CDs now
 that information
 that's the whole account
 and whatever's out there on the on the retire
 just passes right up
 and and the CD and the RAP information
 r retirement account processing system talk together
 When you get another vendor in here
 we physically have to put the papers together
 S

 Right
 The the
 I got a f
 Oh
 I love expansions of business

 The phone number by the way is
 Yeah
 five five five five POUND
 Is what the phone number will be
 But
 this is things that
 I'm I'm anxious for Matt to get here
 I'm getting tuckered out
 trying to get all these nitty gritty things

 But see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead
 in order to or have business cards
 LCL in in Chicago needs that
 to get that process going
 Uh is there LCL accounts gonna be maintained here
 cause cause actually
 or is there gonna be a separate
 They're gonna have an account in Chicago
 is that
 Well
 w what we'll do is
 those'll probably wire transfer out
 through the Fed
 what
 I think what will happen
 but we
 Matt'll find this out
 and I'm
 I'm not
 whichever way it goes is fine
 will be
 everyone who makes
 who buys a fund
 that money will go into a a clearing account here
 And then
 we will
 either LCL will will ACH it out of us
 Or
 we'll physically wire it up there
 You know
 there may be a hundred thousand dollars in there
 which may represent three people's
 or four people's purchases
 and then Matt faxes the paperwork up to LCL
 and they do the suitability testing
 and then they know what products have been bought
 and then on the other side
 we do a wire transfer
 to physically get the money up there
 Si similar to Fannie Mae
 Ex ex
 Uh yes
 We we we collect monies
 and
 and then
 we tell them how much of it is theirs
 and
 by calling up there
 and then it they zap it the next day
 I don't know if
 like
 that's the same way that American Express with the traveler's checks work
 When we sell Traveler's Checks
 we put that money in a clearing account
 and then Jo Anne
 whosever doing that job
 calls a number
 and
 we report
 how much in sales we had
 and they d
 they d hit the account the next day and take the money out
 But that's
 that's kind of the the mechanics of the of the flow of funds
 But
 LCL
 that office will not say First National Bank of Hillsdale
 or anything of the nature
 Yeah
 Uh
 the
 his his card will be LCL investments
 at First National Bank of Hillsdale
 Um
 letterhead will be LCL
 there needs to be a separate phone line
 POUND going to that office POUND
 And we'll
 the receptionist will also answer it
 but when they pick up the phone
 you know we'll put it on a red line
 or blue line or something like that
 when they pick up that line
 you know they they pick up
 and it's also requirements by
 I guess NASDAQ or whomever
 and the comptroller that
 they don't want us
 when that line rings
 Q oh yeah
 you do have LCL in investments Q
 They they talk about in the regulation
 and I'm pretty confident they'll they'll implement those out
 Is Matt gonna carry on his other livelihood that he had before
 through that office
 is he totally out of the insurance business
 He was meeting with
 and he was going to to tell him
 that
 he's plans to take a job here
 C Common courtesy says
 that he needs to give em two weeks notice
 But
 the the practice within the the industry
 and Larry
 Matt said this
 So
 I know it's not Matt's employer
 I've decided to move on to another
 another customer
 or an another employer
 ni
 N I'll g
 see if she's gonna be
 Or else I'll give her a call tomorrow
 Um
 they typically say well fine
 thanks for the two weeks notice
 And then they electronically transfer his licenses
 to his
 to to LCL
 so these slides should be real interesting
 Yeah
 a good slide show
 Too bad you can't make it
 Who else do you know that's been there besides what's her name
 Just Jessie and Shana
 Yeah
 I wanna go
 But
 Hunh
 I'd like to go
 It's an interesting thing though

 you know
 since it is such
 m
 it's restricted
 No
 Isn't Nicara gua one of the things you
 we have
 We have f f
 Technically speaking
 full diplomatic re lations with Nicaragua
 you know an American ambassador there
 I
 who
 like a nest of CIA spies
 That's just
 there
 but there n
 but I thought it w
 it's not like going to Cuba
 Where they have to make connections through Mexico because
 But I won der whether this
 It is
 how long
 They say Lebanon is actually
 how long's
 they
 and and I
 For a few years
 There's quite a few pla
 There's only a
 there's only a handful of places
 How long has it been illegal for Americans to

 Since the fif
 you know
 from like the time of Cath
 the Castro revolution
 overturned travel restrictions
 on the
 on the passport
 and said that the government couldn't
 really
 permit you from going anywh

 And then
 tha
 to do
 visa res restrictions
 I think Cuba
 Now Leba non
 Unhunh
 are the only places that
 maybe North
 maybe Vietnam also


 you're
 supposedly
 but
 you really
 They know
 the thing is
 what I'm wondering
 people that go to Nicara
 and less o
 less often to Nicar
 to North
 to Vi etnam
 And that's what's sort of worrisome
 That's what's worri worrisome
 but that I'm sure
 if they
 but I'm saying

 but he's a
 The only one un der the age of sixty

 And it's really funny
 a
 possibly even keep an eye on you
 or watch you
 I don't know how many Americans have been to Nicar agua
 I doubt it
 There're de
 there're delegations that
 a lot of del

 Well there
 they d
 and there
 left
 leftish
 and
 but
 I would love
 I would love to go
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I wanna go too
 I'd
 I


 I think Mexi co's like the place to go

 and all other other things in his life
 you know
 he plays hard
 as they say

 and yet he
 Nothing like a man

 Nothing a man wants after a tough day of working hard
 than than twelve six packs


 than a bunch of vitamin pills
 and six
 twelve six packs
 yeah
 right




 and yet he
 yet
 as strong as an ox
 you have
 You have all these internal organs
 Yeah
 Thank God

 it's kind of sad when you think about like Bruno
 ex boy friend
 skinny little guy
 who's always been sickly

 and and
 he w he
 he used to say to my brother
 But he really meant it
 you're real lucky
 and here you are P fucking it up P
 You knew he
 Oh

 with Harry it was obvious
 I never knew he had dr
 S Yeah
 Harry is a
 yeah

 Really
 yeah
 I mean Harry
 like
 He'd have r tons of money
 he like would go

 He'd get paid once a week
 that kind of shit
 Jewelry
 all kinds of things like th
 He still lives
 Oh he's fine now
 Oh

 No
 I'm real proud of him

 he doesn't even
 He doesn't even eat cake with r(um) in it
 No
 No alcohol
 I mean abso lutely no
 He's
 and
 he goes
 He set up his
 on Thursday nights
 he's holding it


 It's really funny

 Isn't that
 Well I had given him up for dead
 I told X
 I always told her
 it's gonna XX
 and she's
 I'd given him up for dead
 But you have to
 just torn to pieces
 My mother's never happy
 My mother wouldn't be happy if everything was
 excuse me
 she has always had her s
 her
 her kids to worry about
 miserable
 poor Joanne
 oh
 poor Harry
 poor Q
 and she's totally happy now
 I mean there's no

 Cause that's just the way she is
 It's kind of like you Ken
 That's not at all like me Joanne


 You have no reason to be miserable
 I'm
 first of all I'm not miserable
 I have plent
 VOX I have a happy pers VOX

 you have no reason to be mis


 You're not miserable at all
 honey
 There's one of the reasons right there
 you shouldn't

 Aw
 PAT you shouldn't PAT be miserable
 everything
 You th
 you talking
 HI what is sh
 sh sh
 Q my son's not a drug addict
 I mean what is
 th
 I think i

 I think
 one of her complaint
 who knows what her complaint
 and
 and the d

 It never ever ends


 Look at that
 it's
 Is
 Uh

 It's really ama zing
 He he ca
 t tw takes his nails
 and he flutters em in front of it
 Yeah
 It's really ama
 Have you read why that's done
 XX
 Oh and that's in the turtle book XX
 that's their
 That's their
 it's their mating courtship ritual
 And when
 when she's interest ed
 you know







 He's trying
 She doesn't
 See
 He's got these real real long finger nails
 Yeah
 The real long
 the ma
 The males have those l
 and
 I love the little fl
 It's really amazing
 And yet she's not running from him
 she was frantically running around
 Now
 I don't really know
 I mean I haven't
 I haven't s bothered to sit around and catalog
 this I think is fairly light
 I think this is
 Could be foreplay
 This is

 Yes it could be


 And she's kinda


 she's not really
 but she's not showing a lot of interest
 I think when he starts biting her
 Does it al ways get curved like that
 You know
 I think when he starts biting her
 that's when he's
 Do you know
 he's a lot more interested

 She's a glutton
 h e was larger than her

 I mean I
 I just can't imagine
 She's gonna be as big as that turtle in the pet shop
 it is just
 They've had this thing
 th this turtle for like thirty years
 It does
 What are you gonna do when it gets this big
 You're gonna have to have a
 old bathtubs aren't hard
 aren't hard to find

 I give her a qu swift kick into the LA river
 You kidding me
 How could you abandon her about twenty y
 she alr
 Yes she doe s
 X
 Oh a few worms
 Well
 You know what
 she'll be supporting you
 You know
 I'm gonna b
 What am I gonna
 You know what though Ken

 they z
 and grapes

 No
 he
 That he refuses
 cheap
 they love
 Sadistic
 HI I'm not gonna HI k_give them
 and they won't HI let me see it HI
 XXX
 you know
 watching it like go like
 like pick goop off the bottom

 You know
 and then that gets a little shock
 the thing it will actually be half swimming
 They d
 and then the
 flutters around the tank trying to get away from him
 I don't have the heart for that kind of thing
 when you say it that way
 I don't think I could stand it eith
 Well you know what I was doing
 I would once a week
 Tuesday
 we we named it Sissy
 like right in front of all the kids
 and I would get buy a feeder locally
 and I would put it in the little thing
 hunt
 you know
 we would watch Sissy hunt the goldfish
 And the go
 and t was so h

 HI Yeah HI
 It would l eat only live things
 Th that's the only way they feed
 Yeah they won't eat
 some k

 some k inds of sn akes won't eat
 eat dead things
 Oh yeah
 and then it would
 But they'd put it in a little
 in like a little cup a little water
 cause it'll only eat it live
 you know
 and then the snake would start to
 And it would start to do this whole little dance
 Then it would start s
 it would start moving
 at the same pace that the snake would b
 kinda following it
 It would be like this little whirlwind
 And all of a sudden it would go chk
 And you know what's so funny
 The snake
 was v
 th they're v
 they're very b
 th
 Cause it

 it would rarely get the fish
 it w
 then the fins would all get
 And
 the kids loved it
 Well
 They lo
 and
 I had one little girl
 And she was this sensitive sweet little girl from Guatemala
 Who was
 And every time
 She she did
 She crossed herself
 for the fish
 For the Fish
 And I asked her
 little fishy
 was n't that sweet VOX
 And then
 from that point
 And then from that point on
 everybody would be sitting there
 looking at the fish anxiously
 and I would have to tell em to sit down
 others can't see

 She
 would turn around
 Well
 And she was
 you know i
 and she no
 She was
 Oh
 I know
 What was so funny is

 about it
 And
 Y
 the snake
 Sissy s MRC ate the fish MRC
 and Ana cried

 That was like their
 and it was really fu
 they'd
 they'd do their sentences
 crying
 And what did she write
 U m
 Sissy ate the fish and I cried
 I



 Ki
 the f
 And I wouldn't
 I'd
 I would have it from the morning
 or I'd pick it up the n
 that's what I'd do
 if it w
 I would pick it up Monday
 I would take it home
 And that was the worst part
 and I would like put it in
 I would leave it in its plastic bag
 put it in a bunch of water
 I didn't wanna get friendly with this fish
 You know
 and then I would take it in
 and I would put it in a paper bag
 And so I wouldn't look at it
 And I would put it like over by the sink in the classroom
 Only when it was put into the bowl
 it was
 I was the worst
 You didn't wanna get
 Listen to her
 it was really
 f

 XXX X

 Yeah
 to see it
 is not as
 I remember once


 go to an elementary school
 right around the corner from it
 Anyway


 Where was y el
 where
 And there's all those little shops


 On Hol
 On Vermont
 like w maybe
 six shops up from
 from um
 rather
 Um
 there was a little pet shop called Pandora's Pets

 WH Pandor's pets WH
 they had this fish in there called an Oscar
 And they are these like
 they are these really
 I remember
 They're these big gnarly suckers
 They're like m
 f
 they only eat like other fish

 you know like goldfish
 Poor guys
 They're like the
 anyway
 anyway so
 in every pet shop
 I remember w watching them feed the Oscar once
 And they dropped in the goldfish
 But this time particularly sticks in my mind
 He drops the goldfish into the tank
 and the Oscar sneaks up behind it
 And like creates a vacuum kinda thing cause
 you got this huge mouth
 Yeah and
 and then
 And it doesn't even XX XX
 and then
 But the goldfish got stuck
 MRC half way into his mou th MRC
 Mouth first
 Well it was going
 That's the problem
 Anyway
 So
 you got this Oscar there
 with like

 a goldfish

 you know
 the the head of a goldfish
 bloop
 bloop
 bloop VOX
 and the Oscar's there swimming around
 VOX massively expressive faces VOX

 HI but I think it was worried
 You know
 it g it's going

 I was just imagining what was going through its little mind

 frantically trying to dislodge it

 And um HI
 finally it d did manage to
 v like loosen it
 I don't know remember if it spat it out or
 or what
 But it managed to like
 you know
 dis lodge it
 Well um
 I wanted to say I'm really happy with the stuff I got now

 Good
 And I'm really basically I'm back for a tape deck
 Oh ok ay
 So um
 one of my thoughts is
 that um
 well
 I want a tape deck that's gonna sound about
 you know
 and I think I want a tape deck with two
 places for two tapes
 Okay
 but I've never done this before
 I don't know much about tapes
 I mean I h
 I have a boombox
 So
 I wonder if you would suggest that this Luxman is the
 is w one of the things you'd wanted me to think about

 Um
 the
 Would you
 you would want the
 the ability

 of the double cassette deck
 just purely for taping from one tape to the other
 That's its main purpose
 In fact I wouldn't know what other purpose it _would have
 is if
 you can load up two tapes in it
 like
 I see
 where it will continually play
 Okay
 all four sides
 That's probably not gonna hap pen
 It's mainly for copying
 Okay
 And the tapes you'd be copying

 are they gonna be straight music
 Mmostly
 Okay
 Okay
 or desire a pretty decent

 copy of your original tape
 right
 Um
 And the originals will be from music lovers
 who probably have
 pretty good systems
 Not
 I'm
 P But P
 Anyway

 because on a
 um
 a tape deck like that
 you realize
 you know
 Mhm
 the original sour ce was
 or even as that tape was
 mhm
 mhm
 in the generation of making that copy

 And
 I mean how


 you're you're gonna have that loss
 just because of all the different things involved
 Right
 f from
 taking it from one tape
 and putting it on the other tape

 So you're you're bound to lose something
 Yeah
 It's not huge
 Right
 Uh which is a small amount
 and
 you'll st still be able to enjoy the
 the music
 and the message it's trying to bring across
 mhm
 okay
 Um
 the other thing I realize is

 think about how much of the time you're gonna be doing that
 Mhm
 Because of
 You are paying a decent premium
 to have that conve nience
 mhm
 so what kind of price difference are we talking about

 And let my friends copy tapes for me and
 Right
 like let's say there would be about
 um
 couple different steps

 a single cassette deck
 um
 that would

 play the tape
 you know
 Okay
 Right
 And Luxman has a great cassette deck
 to fill those needs
 And um
 all of their cassette decks come with a five year parts and labor warranty
 you know
 put into them
 Uh
 They really put a lot into them
 they're pretty conservative in their

 specifications
 what they say their cassette decks will do
 they will y usually out perform that
 Okay
 And
 all the units

 will

 go along with that
 and
 um
 as far as the remote control funtions go
 The decks come with
 what's called a DIN cable
 and that plugs in to the unit you have now
 right
 Okay
 This would be
 Right
 to integrate into your system
 okay
 this gives you
 a lot of pluses that
 most people's basic decks don't have
 Okay
 Mhm
 without cutting the high frequencies
 Right
 regular Dolby is Dolby B
 That's like um
 when you buy tapes at the Wherehouse
 they're in Dolby

 in addition to that it gives you Dolby C
 Mhm
 When you're making your own tapes at home
 Um
 Dolby C
 You don't want to
 mix and match
 the
 It doesn't sound quite right
 Nkay
 So this gives you that
 mhm
 r h
 really expensive cassette decks
 Hm
 And that i is
 an improvement in the recording section of it
 and it allows you to record a little bit
 so you hear less tape hiss
 um

 hm
 M hm
 and um
 from there
 the next step
 for what you're looking at
 would be the kay one ten
 Okay the kay one ten basically has all functions that we just talked about on the on the kay one eleven
 um
 with the addition of
 the convenience feature of having auto reverse
 Yeah
 And that's nice

 Where
 it will play side B
 automatically
 Where you don't have to get up and flip the tape
 The other thing about it is
 you can flip the tape over at any point in the middle
 right
 and
 the other thing
 y let's say if you're entertaining
 you can put in a ninety minute tape
 put it on continuous auto reverse
 and
 play side A
 Um
 so that's what it gives you in the kay one ten
 the
 dual
 or double cassette deck
 that Luxman offers
 is basically
 a um
 double version of the kay one ten
 And they call it the kay one ten double u
 Okay
 And
 the
 the kay one ten is four hundred eighty dollars
 Alright
 and the kay one ten double u
 okay
 Okay
 So you paid a hundred dollar premium for auto reverse
 then you're paying another hundred dollars to have
 Yeah
 double cassette deck that's auto reverse
 Mhm
 Whe re
 um
 they even have
 um
 you know
 dubbing
 or copy ing
 mhm
 Um
 so it's really set up
 to be just cranking out

 copies
 Now the other thing is
 it has a feature where it will do it in half the time
 Or high speed dubbing
 Hm
 Which is sometimes nice
 so it doesn't take the whole period of time
 To make your copy
 Mhm
 Um
 so we
 how
 a high speed copy
 um
 The other thing that sets this apart
 for each cassette deck
 Mhm
 Ge
 gesundheit
 Thank you
 yeah
 where a lot of units will
 just have a Dolby setting
 Mhm
 made
 you wanna record it in Dolby B
 and in your automobi le's cassette player
 mhm
 Uh
 in that scenario
 you're gonna want to play it back in Dolby C

 Okay
 That's good
 Nkay
 and you had your prize tape
 mhm
 put it on continuous

 um
 unhunh
 auto reverse
 and it will play side A side B of one tape
 go over to the other tape
 and play sed ai
 side A
 then side B
 and it con tinually go forever
 O kay
 Hunh
 which is kinda nice
 Now the other thing you can do with this deck is
 in your system
 you can make a copy
 while you're listening to something else
 n kay
 O kay
 the other thing you can do is

 as I recall
 one can listen to the tuner
 so you could put on KDB
 or I
 I
 r there's one Matt likes
 I forget what it's called
 but anyhow
 Right


 Which is kind of tough
 so you could be listening to the radio
 while taping a CD
 You you know
 Right
 Okay
 Which
 you have to pay attention to what you're doing
 yeah
 but at least you have that flexibili ty
 from what you've told me

 you know
 good quality copies of tapes
 mhm
 And integrate well with your system
 Okay
 I actually may
 I mean
 And it may well be that I
 I'd do better
 just going back to one of these others
 Mhm
 in
 The oth
 in fact
 I'm
 the oth
 the other thing I was gonna say is
 is it
 do you have

 if you had some other type of quality cassette deck
 Mhm
 Even if it was a
 unf
 one in the office
 or
 yeah
 I could somehow hook it up into your system
 mhm
 Right
 one of these
 okay
 that's possible
 And
 the

 since you've bought ouple pieces here
 I'm sure we can work something else out for you
 how well
 h
 let's see here

 the kay one eleven
 which is the
 but h
 I don't
 When I say basic
 I mean basic in their line

 you'd be looking at three hundred forty nine dollars
 nkay
 The

 let's see here
 the kay one ten

 we could do four hundred and forty five
 right
 and the kay one ten double u
 we could do five thirty nine
 mhm
 Well
 And I th
 I believe
 there's one that we didn't talk about
 M hm
 Okay
 and the kay one twelve is basically the audiophile's dream cassette deck

 O kay
 it's a
 it's a single cassette
 and it's single direction
 right
 hunh
 and this will make a superior tape copy

 or a superior tape period
 U m
 Hm
 And what it does
 a separate head for play

 Un hunh
 And

 such as bias fine trim
 Hm

 tailor the cassette deck's electronics
 to the specific tape you're using
 So obviously you can see there's
 a b
 a bit more invol ved with it
 Yeah
 For the purist
 this is the way to go
 Here you're looking at six hundred dollars


 Right
 Okay
 Let me ask you one other thing

 Suppose that
 I wanna use this tape deck

 conversation
 Like we do in
 in linguistics
 Between Matt and me
 Okay
 how does it work
 Let's say go back to the kay one ten
 Uh
 Or the one
 Let's take a look here
 The kay one ten
 Mhm
 has provisions
 you can plug in one microphone
 Yeah


 Mh hunh
 and it will record it on both tracks of it

 and it senses when you plug in the second mic
 And then it has a record level on it
 mhm
 and then also the type of tape you're using
 Hm
 Uh
 so the kay one ten would be set up for that
 Any of the other

 the kay one eleven has it too
 I Take
 I
 Huh
 unhunh
 Okay it's the
 it's the dual one that doesn't
 okay
 The dual one does not have those provisions
 now that doesn't mean that it cannot be done
 Right
 What has to happen then is

 one hooks up a
 Okay
 and then it plugs into your receiver
 YELL Paul
 Yeah
 Y eah
 um

 nkay
 into your tape deck
 Right
 Okay
 So
 m
 which is the single auto reverse
 the kay one eleven has the mic provisions
 And so's the kay one
 O kay
 The b
 The big benefit is the auto re verse
 Um
 I'm one of these weird people that has trouble with auto reverse
 The first time
 And for some reason
 maybe I just have to learn
 when I put the tape in
 So I have a hard time finding

 The way it usually works is



 the side of the tape that's out
 that label side
 mhm
 corresponds with the arrow
 that will point to the right
 There's usually two little arrows that will light up
 Okay the arrow that points to the right
 I see
 the label side of the tape that's facing you
 O kay
 Okay that's the way it usually works
 Now the other thing that throws people off is

 fast forward and rewind

 will vary
 Right
 Right
 all the time
 I just
 I'll
 I'll work on getting used to that
 But I just might go with the single
 you know
 the one that I have to turn it over
 you know
 you know


 I'm trying
 I mean I had a couple recently


 got the kay one eleven
 and
 and they love it
 too
 I'm really in to CD's now
 and then I think they even have a couple books on tape
 it's probably w more than enough

 I really think those are the
 that's the big difference
 this is
 No
 Um
 SING doo doo SING
 I believe
 yeah
 I think that's the basic difference

 Here
 Uh
 we don't really
 we are
 Okay
 And so we
 we've gotten them for clients time to time
 um
 I think we have them available from Sony
 And
 I'd really have to l research that a bit for you
 I
 sort of
 table mic would cost
 Um
 Well
 um

 f ah s
 I would say
 I would expect to pay
 Okay
 the sky's the limit with microphones
 n
 thousand dollar microphone s

 you would proba
 I would spend
 you know I wouldn't spend nineteen dollar s
 Yeah
 Okay
 and then
 maybe a little up above that
 I I don't ever see paying
 that
 that would probably be
 right
 So that kind of gives you an idea


 called Sound Advice
 Yeah
 Al right
 Okay
 He's
 Wayne
 Alright
 Saybeck Shaybeck

 and they're good guys there
 Okay
 So that would be
 that'd be great
 Yeah
 Um
 if we needed to d get a price on a tape r recorder

 Are y

 But
 considered
 I mean there's a lot of different models of Uhers
 but
 they've always been considered
 probably one of the finest portable cassette recorders
 yeah
 Right
 w
 Yeah
 So I could show you what the blue book price was
 Then if I
 it's gonna be hard to d
 it's gonna be hard to determine
 what would be a comparable replacement to day
 Right
 Yeah
 Okay
 Great
 Nkay
 You don't sell that kind of thing here
 Cause this is an audio
 That's right
 place
 to tell you the truth
 okay
 But
 Okay
 overall
 Well
 this is great
 What I think I'll do is
 take these ideas back to Matt
 then yeah
 Yeah
 um
 Mhm
 that's the auto rev
 we have in stock
 Okay
 The kay one eleven
 Hm
 but we're gonna be placing a Luxman order soon
 And
 Mhm

 you know
 you couldn't call me up and then listen to a tape that night
 That's fine
 Um
 but
 we're talking like maybe a week or some thing


 I'm not that
 th SM the timing isn't that tight
 no
 Um
 Pete had told me Matt came by
 I th guess the l l
 y we were talking a bout

 there was an article on
 So
 Do you
 had you heard anything
 ha has he read that and he's thinking
 thinking
 you talked about this with him
 un
 under the roof and everyth

 cause you know
 You can't have that stuff showing

 Not where we are
 Yeah
 Coming along
 putting the
 specs out for bids
 That's progress
 that's

 We're gonna have
 Exactly
 And
 but X
 then if you sit up at night thinking
 Then
 should we go for him
 I know it
 It's just what I was telling Jeff
 I said we got all these places in the specs
 where we're
 we're having to say
 K
 Figure this one separately
 cause we may have to axe it
 You know
 biting our nails
 what th the bot tom line is gonna be
 Th
 maybe
 anyway
 and some parts will
 be a lot less than you thought
 Like windows aren't as expensive as I thought
 So
 it's
 Yeah
 double glazed up there now
 Right
 Yeah
 which some t
 To the cost goes up

 And I
 If you need an addi tional piece
 I can
 h no you're
 Yeah that's what I had looked at
 I think
 is w
 You don't have the
 I have the d the
 the double one here

 single one
 Okay
 The other t
 the other
 the single auto reverse
 I have in stock
 Okay
 Good
 Thanks so much
 Good
 but I bet
 I bet it's been worse than that before
 It's
 it's


 Good


 Well I think you've got another sale
 So
 Well
 Yeah
 Hm
 yeah
 And even if I go out and ask for it
 I won't feel guilty
 I really won't
 It's just a set of instructions
 a little bit
 and um
 those guys have so much fun writing those programs
 you know
 that's the
 I think that's
 that's pretty
 Yeah well
 That's pretty much the end of it
 And that's pretty much the end of the truthful part of the process
 The rest of it is all marketing
 Hm
 and the marketplace is
 you know
 maybe I think I live in Tangiers
 you know
 Maybe I think the marketplace is

 you get what you can get
 yeah
 Uh
 seems to be that way

 You know
 but just throwing my money out there

 You know


 Heavens yes
 You know
 I mean it happens all over the place

 whose voice they used in the telephone
 the number has been changed
 And that I had

 that lady
 Q the number you have reached
 Hunh
 When she th tried to do that
 hunh
 they certainly use her a lot
 But I mean it
 a s
 it's a

 to say every possible combination
 oh but
 they
 and the computer
 Yeah
 it's like a series of samples
 And it automatically sorts em
 Unhunh
 so it's
 Probably the total actual s speaking that they use
 It would be much more pleasant if they had done all the combinations though
 You know
 and there's something that actually says your number
 in toto
 You know
 and
 Q Thank you Mister Smith





 push two
 if you wish to h Q

 My phone number that I

 if you want to
 h
 Artif icial intelligence personality
 Q if you do not like this personality
 Yeah




 well the networking of computers is getting such that
 you know
 almost anything's possible
 Any XX
 that's why I like it
 just
 and

 could be like last year

 It's like a r

 and it's communication like books
 And it's like
 but when they get
 you can make it happen
 If it just about information
 I mean you can't
 If it's just about information
 You can't conjure something up
 like a car out of nothing
 But


 that's gonna make it
 you know
 mhm
 to have
 all the electronic
 this and that that they want
 Yeah
 And it'll be small
 You know and it
 It'll be f so small
 that we'll have enormous amount

 we should have an enormous supply of it
 yeah like
 Basically
 cheap as a switch these days or something
 ky
 and it
 and start growing this thi those
 silicon chips without any flaws
 they'll be able to
 grow circuitry that is so complicated
 that
 you know
 that gravity destroys it
 so they'll be able to
 uh
 to
 i they'll be able to get these fantastic circuits
 f like say for a whole television set
 And


 a

 is so sensational
 That'll be expensive at first
 God
 But can you
 it'll
 it'll
 it'll be worth it
 In
 This technology out of most of
 m
 anything in the past
 ha has m
 it's becoming like we're shaping our our destiny
 or ourselves
 um
 with this technology
 more than we have in with any other in the past
 just b_like
 whatever we think it b
 we can make it
 but there's one technology that's um
 gonna overtake that
 which is
 bombarding rganisms with radiation
 you know
 But once we do
 we'll be able to program biology as well
 Well that's pretty frightening con cept
 It is frightening but
 We can't even control our freeways

 I know
 you know

 i
 Once it's out there in the open

 the
 Well I hope
 Are you familiar with fractals
 Yeah
 Be cause f
 No
 can be found k

 than it can with regular mathematics

 So
 you know
 and religion and
 and and and bio logy
 ar
 and the
 and the sci
 Pardon
 it was just a branch of knowledge
 Right
 Unhunh
 yeah

 The the
 the totality is taken into account
 as opposed to the observer
 you know
 I remember
 kind of a crusade
 for scientific
 responsibility
 And scientists are
 are taking such control over the world these days
 with their n
 you know
 And the way it's marketed
 and the way we're d
 we develop needs for it
 And I remember this pf cartoon I saw w
 of
 of
 it was called The Scientist
 and it had this
 this wonderful stone statue
 intertwined with each other
 and then they s
 they they looked like they were so intertwined
 and they're a s
 they're a statue
 right
 and the whole base of the statue is crumbling
 Right
 And it's just like rubble
 just below the knees
 down
 a few ttle
 some of it was chipped off
 and d
 this rubble
 was this little man
 who was a scientist
 and he was looking at the rubble

 Hm
 but looking down at the crumbs
 you know
 at the rubble at the bottom
 and
 and
 to me that
 that always symbolized
 the limitations of the scientific method
 Whi
 well
 the to
 the the the whole human experience
 and
 including
 the unbelievable parts of it
 the parts that are just legend
 and
 alluded to
 and the subjec tive

 you know they



 you can't
 And science is a microscope
 Each p_scientist has their
 their field of
 expertise
 and if they're gonna go
 if they're gonna stretch out far enough into the
 the unknown
 where they can find something new
 They have to do it in a straight line
 in all directions at once
 So the problem is communication between s
 they're doing it with mathematics
 I mean
 n no
 but the comm
 problem is
 communication between the branches of science
 mhm
 that's true
 who's gonna be able to hold
 Well
 f the stuff can be understand
 understood
 The goals
 Those people can tell you
 or the cutting
 can be understand
 understood intellectually

 they know the whole structure
 well the
 and somebody looking at the

 You know
 A nd you gotta have somebody
 who's guiding
 and make all the
 yeah
 and
 and
 you know
 I think
 I think that
 one of the reasons that there's been no focus is because
 h
 And was kinda letting the scientific method be the
 be the leader
 The
 just continue inventorying and
 continue inventorying
 You know
 documenting


 and
 instead of
 coming at it from another direction
 trying to find

 trying to find ways to
 to
 like with with Einstein for example

 he was trying to f
 T_he was ex per
 with new ways of doing things
 well thinking about things
 h
 and thinking about things
 and he was trying to
 he w
 trying to discover the speed of his own thought

 I mean
 he was like
 that were all based in a peaceful world

 that couldn't exist unless he was secure
 or that that peace was part of it
 Of what he was about
 and
 so much of today's technology is soulless
 just generally
 chewing up
 you know
 chewing up
 ch n
 j chewing up new w

 some kind of consumer need
 Did you ever get into Tesla

 He had a lot of real wacky ideas on big levels
 that you could
 tap into the air basically
 and
 y
 but
 it
 it interfered with
 well
 I mean
 y
 So
 it wasn't really a very efficient either
 Because you'd have to have a
 an immense amount of power being broadcast
 you know

 if they
 I don't know
 He was dealing with it being basically energy
 you know
 yeah
 alright
 which doesn't really require a conductor
 yeah may
 you know
 So
 I think he was
 I mean he va basically invented the radio
 and stuff like that
 you know

 It's pretty confusing to me
 but
 yeah
 those those guys are the guys I think that are the heroes

 that are the unsung heroes

 the r
 the
 and s
 but business has always
 taken these works
 and manipulated em
 to their benefit
 to our benefit
 wh what the obvious
 or the
 more immediate econo mic
 it's like
 gee
 I mean you just do it
 Well that's what I like about fractals
 is because

 with these new mathematical formulas

 you know
 because it's mathematical
 and it
 I it has to work I guess with numbers in it
 somew some way

 it's opens a door into
 what appears to be all the substance that's underneath the obvious
 You know
 with

 these fractals seem to
 seem to represent
 everything that numbers aren't
 and that's
 but s
 yeah
 well
 it
 like
 _it's a window
 and it's also like a model of reality
 And
 like a fractal can get really close at do
 Yes
 Right
 Um
 it's still n not the totality of a plant
 it's the
 it's an opportunity for them to
 to
 to the chaos
 that exists
 a h as subtext
 and when we're say
 when we're going to

 say blow up the first atomic bomb
 and and and


 cause they didn't know for sure
 whether it would de stroy the universe or not
 Yeah
 Or not

 And
 It might have started a chain reaction that just blew up the whole earth
 and it has
 in disharmony

 in
 in the deterioration of the planet
 we're all worried about the


 th cancer is everywhere

 it's just that the uni
 it's for
 is just a thin shell from how deep
 this phantasmagorical experience goes
 and that when they did that
 that it'll take a while before it
 it
 it really
 you know
 vr goes
 it might take
 a a few th
 it might take five hundred years
 or maybe it's be
 or it might never happen but
 it's
 that was scientific irresponsibility
 And
 of f
 what fractals symbolize

 they
 w
 And
 with the sci entif
 there might have been a little more caution
 there's this window
 but fractals don't
 don't imply any particular morals
 well they imply
 Well all math does that
 Uh
 it's
 just another model
 it's
 to me it's a model
 it's it's a model into the fourth dimension
 you know
 actually
 Um
 but fractal can be applied to
 many dimensions or n
 or just
 I mean
 taking something and dividing it up randomly
 or
 with some system
 it's like nested
 nested values
 basically
 Inside a gallon you have four quarts
 inside of four
 in inside a quart you have
 etcetera etcetera

 well
 I don't see how it's
 it's not
 it's not squared
 I mean it's
 it's
 it's not predictable at all really
 It's
 it's a it's a found pheno menon
 Well it's not predictable if you apply random values to the subdivisions
 The subdivisions have to be random
 They ha
 it has to have randomness to it
 the order
 is understood
 yet
 I mean I might be wrong
 well
 they're calling it
 the equ

 the mathematics of chaos SMOKING
 That's not fractals
 SMOKING It includes other
 it includes
 it i
 yeah
 I mean
 and chaos is se
 they overlap
 Mhm
 Chaos I guess is basically analysis of noise
 For the scientist
 the scientist has never hav
 you see

 see that's w
 that's the point that I'm trying to get at
 because the scientific method now has that tool of overlap
 Hm
 and
 that is an opportunity for
 to meet spirituality
 Yeah well
 there's u
 in physics
 There's oppor tunities to meet spirituality
 twenty four hours a day wherever you go
 just by being alive
 If they don't wanna see it
 A lot of people will
 because they follow the scientific impulse
 and
 fractals may be the very thing that boggles them out enough
 is my theory
 Yeah
 Maybe
 They'll probably find it in something
 I think
 it's like all the the ideas that we have
 they're just sort of echos of
 the past
 And they come under different names and things
 Just like
 the latest power now is corporations
 like governments
 principalities
 before that it was gangs


 s but

 it's unbelievable
 and and the pursuit of
 spirituality
 has taken on many forms
 And if a person wants to find it in
 in something they believe in
 well that's very true

 that
 I think that that
 that people who find spirituality in science
 as their f sole spiritual source are
 people that are fucking up the planet
 You know
 I don't think science is the
 I've been watching Two Thousand And One lately
 I mean that's what that's all
 i
 a major theme in it
 the race between the human and the
 and the tech no
 and its
 and its technological manifestation of
 well I
 we built
 Is it gonna m do us
 is our creation
 Is our creation going to
 destroy us
 Yeah

 Man delbrot
 oh
 Yeah
 I thought they were showing that on the ads



 Little too hip
 So they're color cycling right now
 Does it zoom later
 Yeah
 and I
 M(TSK)
 This one's Fractal Fantasy
 Hunh
 and the other one is
 Fractal Zooms
 b and then I've got a test film from IBM laboratories
 of
 f

 taking a Julia set into the fourth dimension
 Hm
 which th
 it's pretty f
 be
 back in the barn
 or from the barn yet
 X
 Um
 A little bit of pain in his abdomen
 or gastroenteritis
 or what the problem is
 Um
 and sending him home

 we may need to take some rays
 or something in there
 I didn't feel anything in his belly
 yeah
 A lot of times if they get into garbage or dead things
 they'll just get an upset stomach
 and

 also a little bit of
 well
 just inflamation in in there
 and and just feel bad
 So

 I
 You know
 how he does
 Um
 hopefully the antibiotics will calm down any any infection
 that he

 or if he gets worse
 be sure and let us know
 well
 but
 Um
 we may need to see him
 we
 so

 Mhm
 Sh
 what on your sheet
 what was the cost for the cast that you charged about
 what do we gen erally
 With the cast
 Okay
 And then
 She had
 pretty much when we rechecked her
 So we didn't have to do any more rays or anything
 I'm trying to remember
 like
 with the white
 You got
 I thought you rayed it
 You rayed it with the cast on
 yeah
 and it was ready to come off
 She did a real good job of keeping it
 keeping it clean
 and dry
 That's
 I think
 half the battle
 she didn't have any sores
 Kristen
 for the tranquilizer what do we
 I wonder if she would need more
 and it'll be
 Oh he'll
 X XX Biotal
 if you just
 Metofane
 We just
 or even
 And then you don't have to worry about em
 What was
 what would that
 Total
 thirteen extra
 to put this cast on
 Cause if you don't
 then y
 It's bad
 As we know from the sheep
 Well
 Just
 Yeah
 Do you like em
 Did you make em
 I made em
 Yeah
 ah
 chocolate chip cookie bar
 And then as I got through the recipe


 They're good
 So they're actually more like granola bars than
 They must have
 cookie bars
 Yeah
 and
 oatmeal
 and peanut butter chips
 chocolate chips
 Okay
 with the
 rays
 and then
 WH WH
 Does that sound right
 f we
 she woke up
 we could w send her home tonight
 I wouldn't see why we couldn't send her home tonight
 fine
 Oh well
 Sh if sh
 Never mind


 na na na
 And she won't have any an antibiotics
 Cause using all
 Thirty two
 What is this
 they're still opposite

 Yeah
 That looks all right

 For the distemper vaccine
 No
 I felt horrible doing that on that eye dog
 that he had in here last week
 Cause he had down
 twenty five plus eighteen

 Well
 Well
 all we did
 I was in here and put a bandage on

 then
 Yeah
 He's

 Let's see

 Six
 fifty six
 one of these and one of these
 one of those

 fifty three
 and Pred
 So
 We'll se how
 to make sure he's all right

 XX
 XX there
 No
 I was just trying to figure out what we spent already
 Mm
 We've already spent fifty for him
 and I want him to spend another hundred
 Well
 Right
 two hundred or
 Yeah
 Any
 pretty much any time you can
 you know
 Well
 we could
 Mhm
 But
 still
 it's more expensive
 I think it'll do fine with a cast
 And it's not displaced
 should be pretty stable
 It'll be kind of a pain getting the
 well
 maybe not
 Maybe not
 Well
 as long as she's
 Okay
 I'll give him a call
 from home
 In back in from the barn yet or not
 XXXXXXXX
 Well
 called both the house number
 a little kid answered
 Yeah and they're little little kids too

 Yeah Carol
 It's Marcia
 Hi

 we got rays done already
 and
 I was gonna let you know what
 what was going on
 Should I talk to Richard
 or you okay
 Okay
 Um
 It looks like she's got a spiral fracture
 Of
 of her tibia
 which is the bone between the knee and the hock
 and
 um
 It's f
 pretty stable
 It's not displaced very far anyway
 and it's

 pretty much
 you know

 she would do fine with a cast
 Um
 and
 with the
 oming in yesterday
 and the rays and everything
 the bill was about fifty four
 And

 with the anasthesia
 probably the
 It's gonna be about a hundred and fifty three
 And
 the only extra would be
 in about six to eight weeks
 we would tranquilize her
 and take the rays
 and see if it's healed
 Enough to take off
 And that's generally about thirty four to forty
 Yeah
 You know
 it would probably be even a hundred more
 it's
 That's about the
 at this point the
 the least expensive alternative
 for her
 Um
 So
 have him call me back
 if you
 Okay
 And if she

 Okay
 whenever
 Okay
 Mhm

 Gee

 She's
 she's gonna
 I imagine they might
 VOX Oh you've grown
 he's just getting his adult XX
 Pretty unusual with that
 XXXX
 XX
 XXX
 Yeah
 You felt the needle
 aw VOX

 Okay
 I talked to Carol
 and
 Okay
 And they've got a dog
 and she was dripping some blood Saturday night
 He's wondering what it may be
 They wa
 I don't know
 Who's that that called

 You stay here

 I'l l be right back VOX
 Yeah
 could be
 Who's aborting
 they got a dog that's pregnant and
 and their dog's dripping blood and they're wondering why
 I heard
 and I thought it was him
 he didn't give his name
 p whatever that shopping thing is on the radio
 On Saturday morning
 And I thought
 that's probably who that was
 Last week
 x
 Well
 with all
 Well
 or two weeks from now
 Mom
 do I really have to go through and r read this
 I notice on one of them I skipped two sentences
 They weren't really important
 and so now I'm paranoid that I'm gonna skip a bunch more so I have to go back and proofread
 Not at this point

 Your ten minutes are up
 And I've proofread the whole thing

 How many pages do you have to copy
 Just two more
 actually
 okay
 in ten minutes you'll go
 figure out
 if I'm gonna rewrite them or leave them the same
 and just write them out
 Well y
 Then you need to go downstairs and finish it
 I'm fine
 Melissa
 It's nine o'clock in the evening
 I can skip algebra
 No you can't
 you
 You need to be able to concentrate and get it done
 and you'll also see him on the weekend
 MRC So what MRC
 well
 That was rude


 You know

 are you listening
 Yeah

 I don't care if it's erasable
 HI I didn't HI
 I know
 don't
 I know
 This is your fi nal
 you gave me F another ten minutes
 warning
 Okay
 I retract all my arguing
 No
 (SNIFF
 Doesn't work in this household
 You may use my desk
 Well wait a minute
 Yes it is
 SING Sym phony
 a
 You wanna go down there and sit
 Dun dun dun dun dun da da SING
 VOX No
 I wanna be able to be with you VOX
 Did dad watch Perot
 So do
 last night
 I don't think so
 I figured he'd be interested in hearing him at least

 to listen to him
 One thing is
 you'll get in a big family
 ar gument
 and Mom
 Or no
 Well anyway
 either way
 Either way

 or something like that
 And then
 they went on
 or the whole dinner time
 about

 the political views
 And so Mom told me never ever to ask
 Could you grab me a box of tea

 Like what all do they believe
 P I'll just use that P
 Dumb question
 It's not pleasant to talk about politics with anyone who doesn't believe
 not believe
 but doesn't
 Agree with you
 vote in the same way that you vote
 WH XX WH
 so

 Noble
 was sitting
 on this side
 and she says something about
 Clinton
 and about
 I forget what she said
 and was just kind of
 something about that
 end of SM conversation SM

 I don't wanna hear any more


 Missis Noble's definitely very democratic
 F VOX Mom
 I'm going VOX F
 Anyway
 I think that isn't
 not a good reason to MRC base your decision though MRC


 VOX See I didn't miss anything VOX
 Good
 Then I can get one of our great erasers
 and just
 go
 Wh
 There isn't one anymore
 Cause it's
 SM It's going to be erased SM
 it's ACCENT symphony ACCENT

 Draw n

 Where
 Chin Kim
 Korean
 Uh
 Violinist
 Hm
 who makes his living
 from doing this
 M hm
 He's really good
 Understatement
 So it was pretty neat
 we hadn't been to a concert in
 I don't know when
 this symphony does pretty good
 And Vodnoy
 it's been eigh teen years

 I'll
 Well
 they call it
 They do
 Because they draw a lot of people from
 you know like music teachers from Kalamazoo
 Who play in it
 you mean
 I remember hearing some guys complaining
 Q they call it Twin Cities
 you know
 so they changed it
 and
 Don't put that on the floor
 They did a pretty nice job
 You know

 And we got this new XX center out here
 Are all those
 major
 positions paid
 auditorium
 Is everyone who plays in that symphony paid
 They don't get paid much
 But they get paid a little
 And
 it's not really high paying
 It's sel
 No no
 It's it
 for per formances
 Hm
 I don't think they
 I don't think they get paid for all that rehearsal time
 My cello teacher
 I could ask John Nelson
 But he's
 But see he's a teacher though
 He makes his money teaching
 Mhm
 And
 he
 and he plays in
 Does he teach just cello
 What
 Is that
 oes he teach just cello
 Yeah
 You can't teach more than one instrument
 really
 really really good I think
 Could get X
 You have to be
 you have to focus at once
 really be able to work
 Yeah
 you know like on a school year
 a weekend
 Of course he comes down here on the week ends

 maybe up in Kalamazoo
 Maybe he
 he's in Kalamazoo
 Does he live in Kal amazoo
 Yeah
 Oh
 So he may go
 So he could go
 on a afternoon
 per haps
 after school hours
 you know
 It's hard telling
 He seems like a prety nice guy though
 Or
 He's strictly
 pri
 Just totally cello

 VOX Hello Ron VOX
 Let's go and sit in the living room
 We did this thing about


 in science books and you see the solar system
 How it's so out of scale
 and
 you cannot get a scale for d

 distance
 and at the same time get objects
 Nice
 But we're trying to do a scale for
 they had this thing drawn for a scale for distance
 So
 we started at one end of the hallway with a roll of toilet paper
 Unhunh
 and so you go so many
 VOX four hundred and eighty three VOX
 you know s
 Pieces of toi
 That you could have that l VOX
 POUND For POUND Jupiter

 Distance like how wide it is
 like four and a half inch squares of toilet paper
 down the
 in the hall
 What hall
 Is that the junior high
 And
 That we go by XX
 But then
 POUND POUND
 Starting from the sun
 Then we went about
 I think it was th maybe thirty seven
 you know
 Then he says
 like this
 you know
 not
 no bigger than that

 we
 and we got out to Earth
 and I think it was a paperclip size
 to punch through or something
 You know just to kind of give us an idea of
 How big was the sun
 Did they say
 He had a softball sitting there
 something like that
 When we got out to Jupiter
 of the hole in the middle of a record
 Hunh
 That's mighty large
 You mean a single r
 a single
 a large
 Uh the
 Oh gee
 Yeah
 Yeah
 because otherwise
 Yeah

 or paperclip hole
 What was Pluto
 Pluto must have been
 Well I have the i

 oh
 Wow
 And the di ameter of a staple

 My butt fell asleep ear lier

 Never had that happen before
 Anyway
 ts your butt falls asleep
 I have this whole paragraph written
 XX
 there's a POUND much POUND better way of doing it structurally
 Just
 Because I put this big parenthesy here
 create stress
 Well what I might as well have done
 Create stress onto yourself
 I have
 and he got to hear READ
 this and this and this
 And I interrupted with
 READ he awakened at the silence READ
 parenthesy
 And he got to hear READ
 It totally totally breaks the paragraph
 And I should have just put this together
 the author does a great job
 of describing the silence
 And then did that

 But I don't have time to rewrite it
 No
 VOX No VOX
 I wanna work on this
 VOX No VOX
 Your
 you guys can overhear
 There are
 just
 you go ahead
 What's that


 What is this
 Could try to draw Vodnoy from behind
 get his picture XX
 Yeah like
 I don't know
 if it's due tomorrow
 off of
 Thank goodness
 This is quite a picture Melissa had

 Ron


 What
 Quite a photograph Melissa had here of Granddad
 I thought it was pretty neat
 That was even more remarkable
 We often meditate
 and those who have meditated on the love of Christ
 have imagined again and afresh

 his bleeding wounds
 see him as he died on the cross
 but
 wherever we turn
 in considering the love of Christ
 We turn to the real Jesus
 And
 There there is where our meditation always centers
 That we might know him
 and see the wonder of his love
 And not only hear him as he cries
 but
 in his seeking love
 as the risen Lord
 Uh see him
 with that fish breakfast
 Broiling fish
 Don't you like that
 You know he had that
 he had that breakfast all cooking
 While the disciples were still out in the boat
 And then
 of course he has a special interview with Peter
 Not the first time he'd seen him
 to Peter
 But
 And there are cocks crowing in the distance
 And Jesus says to Peter
 do you love me
 Simon
 son of Jonah
 do you love me
 more than these
 Three times the question
 Because
 as we were saying a bit ago
 the love and the service go together
 If Peter is to be restored in service
 he has to be restored in love
 And when Peter says


 feed my sheep
 tend my lambs
 care for my little ones
 We
 we can't love others
 in the name of Christ
 unless the love for others is a overflow
 of our love for the Lord himself
 The people that we're called to love
 are unfortunately
 not

 warrantably lovable
 We
 The source of our love
 is not how appealing they are
 although
 but
 nevertheless
 basically
 the the fountain of our love
 i is
 the seeking love of the savior
 The self denying love
 That is willing to serve in his name
 Do you love me
 You know
 Jesus didn't ask Peter those questions
 to undercut his love
 or his faith
 He asked those questions to establish it
 And Jesus does the same with you
 my friend
 he does the same
 He does ask you
 do you love me
 Do you really love me
 But he asks it
 in order that you'll be able to say at last with Peter
 you know everything
 You know my heart
 And Lord you know that in spite of everything
 yes Lord I do love you
 Well
 the saving love of the Father
 and the Son
 is also the saving love of the Spirit
 and that's why I read that section from Romans eight
 Uh you see
 God's love is is present in the Spirit
 There there's a wonderful theology of the Spirit
 in
 in the Scriptures
 Um
 Bultmann
 in his commentary on Romans eight

 talks about

 the two ways in which the Spirit i is spoken of
 And

 he talks about
 the the the Spirit in
 the sense of mana
 as in animism
 you have a spirit of of a tree
 or a a stone
 and then you have the more personal concept of the Spirit

 Now
 I d I don't care for his analogy
 but the point is well taken
 Uh
 and as possessed
 You see
 Uh
 we are not demon possessed
 we are Holy Spirit possessed
 And
 Holy Spirit possession
 has a close relationship to demon possession

 You see
 demon possession is always destructive
 because Satan can't create
 And the demon possessed man in Gadare
 he couldn't even give his name
 Uh he
 You know how C S Lewis has done that in his
 adult novels
 but
 S emon possession is personality destructive
 because Satan can only corrode
 But
 only
 The Holy Spirit
 who brought order out POUND of chaos
 the Holy Spirit is the one who frees
 liberates
 the
 the the the Gadarene demoniac thought he was free
 absolute freedom
 and he could treat people
 no dress code
 and so he stripped it all off
 And the he
 he could d treat people any way he wanted to
 And
 and then
 and tore his own flesh apart
 There's demonic liberty
 But
 Uh
 now m
 you'll accuse me of thinking of Holy Spirit liberty
 because

 I remind you
 Uh and
 And we'll pass over other Scriptural ac counts
 that's a little different
 but
 But you Presbyterians want to do everything decently and in order
 Uh but
 Right
 And and the Holy Spirit
 s the one
 who has
 ordered our lives
 If you love me
 Uh I wanna say a little bit more about that in a moment
 The obedience of love
 But the Holy Spirit is the one who orders our lives

 is in possession of our lives
 but the Holy Spirit's also given to us
 he's not only the possessor
 he's also the one who is possessed
 We possess him
 He dwells in our hearts
 Uh
 but we have the gift of the Spirit
 We have the Holy Spirit himself
 The promise of the Father
 Uh they the disciples were to wait
 until that great promise was given
 And so the Holy Spirit given to us
 f
 that sense of the presence of God's love
 And that's why Paul says
 that God pours out his love in our hearts
 By the Holy Spirit
 Now
 there
 does not describe the love that we have for God
 love joy peace so on
 Uh
 Paul isn't talking about
 he's talking about the gift of love that God has for us
 Because he goes on to describe that love of God
 God commends his love toward us
 So it's God's love for us
 Which is
 again

 a wonderful reality
 Because
 if God didn't do that

 we wouldn't have a love for God
 There's no spring of that divine love within us
 It comes from him
 And it does come from him
 And so the Spirit is the spirit of adoption
 Now
 Uh to make us POUND a ware POUND
 we have to know
 that he is our father
 it is the love of God
 the knowledge that he does love us
 that he is present with us
 that becomes of course then the source
 of our love toward him
 Um
 friends

 there's
 there's nothing more important
 For the whole balance
 Than
 to realize
 the
 the wonder
 of our union with Jesus Christ
 Through the Spirit
 Because it's in Jesus Christ that we are united to the Father
 and it is by the Spirit that Christ is present in our hearts
 and it's by the Spirit that the Father is present in our hearts
 Two aspects of union with Christ
 but it always pays to think about it again
 The representative union
 the vital union
 The representative union
 The basis of our salvation
 When Christ died
 we died
 Because he died for us
 He died as our representative
 he died as
 the one
 who bore our sins
 In his own body
 on the tree
 So he was our representative
 Right
 And he represented us
 not only when he died for us
 And then he ascended
 And that's why Paul says in Ephesians
 Why
 Representatively
 Where he is
 we are
 Now
 that's a tremendously
 important of course
 It's happened
 See
 you are a a new creature in Christ
 You have triumphed over sin and death
 You have died to sin
 And Paul's reasoning about how we ought to live
 Uh you know
 it's because
 Christ rose
 that we are to seek the things which are above
 You are risen with Christ
 Because you died with Christ
 therefore mortify sin in your members
 Put to death sin
 In other words
 Because of what Christ did for us
 therefore
 we live out of the fact
 of his perfect work
 And don't forget
 Jesus not only paid the price of your sins
 but remember that he lived a perfect life for you
 That the white robe of righteousness
 it's all that Christ MRC did for you MRC
 Jesus was baptized for you
 Uh let it be done to fill all righteousness
 The righteousness he had to fill for you
 See he he did it all for you
 But then of course the other side of it is
 Jesus Christ is the vine
 and we are the branches
 There is the
 not only the the the legal aspect of that which Christ did for us
 there is the vital aspect
 as he lives in us
 and and we walk with him
 Uh
 every
 y y you know
 i t's
 it's been long fashionable in theological circles to
 sniff at the hymn
 I walked in the garden alone
 all this romantic business
 and
 and not a shred of theology in the whole hymn
 and yet everybody perversely seems to love it
 Uh well

 I I I think
 in spite of its
 theological vacuity
 is that it's experientially
 retty much on target

 We've all known those precious times of of genuine fellowship with the Lord
 that
 that
 And

 and the knowledge that we have of him
 is the knowledge of love
 We just simply love him
 Uh
 we
 ow the mystics
 l love to talk about
 we've got some kind of time constraint here
 what what
 w w w when do we
 When
 so
 well
 I I gotta be
 finish what you have to say
 I I well
 Let me try to finish what I'm talking about here but
 but
 SM there there
 to talk to types like you SM
 you know it's wonderful


 it's particularly wonderful
 but

 But
 but
 really
 the the that
 you know the Christian mystics talked about climbing Jacob's ladder
 And
 you you you'd come up the ladder
 at the very gate of heaven
 And maybe
 maybe the gate will open
 Y you can't control it
 but maybe it will open
 And when it opens
 it's
 light bursting in your inner heart
 And
 once you've had that experience
 you'd give anything to have the experience repeated
 And so
 you go through any amount of discipline
 and
 and
 you recite the Jesus prayer thousands of times with the monks of Mount Athos
 and
 and
 you think it may happen
 Uh the
 Well now
 tha
 and
 I think Christians sometimes have
 mingled that psychological experience

 whether it's the left part or
 or something
 I don't think

 the
 the psychologists are as sure as they once were
 but
 at any rate

 you see
 it isn't that we have to climb the ladder
 And
 I'm I'm sorry that that whole episode with Jacob got misunderstood
 All because
 all because of the Hebrew preposition al
 That
 Uh that see

 he he stood upon
 not it
 ee
 he Jacob st saw the stairway
 a tower of Babel type of thing
 a
 a zigarot
 r right
 which was made for the gods to touch down at the top
 and then they could come down
 But but
 and then the god could be with the people
 But

 but it it wasn't that that God
 that that Jacob saw God at the top of the ladder
 God stood upon him
 Uh the the masculine there
 the
 v v v vowel with the little dot over it
 you know the the the holem
 Uh he he he's

 and you know that's what it is
 because the second time when God appeared to b h j Jacob at Bethel

 See
 So
 That's what we miss
 He wasn't standing up there at the top
 he came down the ladder
 And when he came down the ladder
 And that's why Jacob said
 this is the gate of Heaven
 It was the House of God
 See
 it it's
 So God was revealing himself to Jacob
 and God reveals himself to us
 And
 he seeks us
 As we seek him
 And our love is always in response to his love
 And it's the assurance that your God loves you
 that he seeks you
 that he's with you
 It's this assurance
 that draws you to repentance
 Um
 the
 h
 And
 who quickens your love
 Well
 I'm not going to say
 th the rest of the things I I had in mind to say
 But
 I
 you can fill out the talk for me
 would you please sometime
 the the commitment of love
 Um
 remember
 Mary's adoration
 Uh when she brought the spikenard
 and
 And Judas criticized her remember
 Uh because

 Don't worship Jesus
 Uh
 but
 Uh y you see


 What was the answer that Jesus gave

 but in the sense of observing it
 Observing a a an observance against his burial
 Uh so
 and she realized who he was
 He said the poor you have with you always
 you have not always
 A tremendous assurance of his own deity
 But Jesus said it
 and
 you see what that says to us
 Uh
 if our Lord were here
 then we could pour out perfume on his feet
 He's not here
 But who is
 The poor you have with you always
 So whose feet can we anoint
 The feet of the poor
 in his name
 See
 Uh
 love doesn't mean
 h climbing up Jacob's ladder to the heavenlies
 where nobody else can be around
 The love of God is experienced in the community of the saints
 it's experienced as we all reached out
 reach out
 and the love of God is experienced
 in the course of service
 A I heard you describe some of these service projects
 that
 Intervarsity is involved in
 and friends

 these these projects
 even if they're working about rebuilding old houses
 or whatever
 they are not things that have nothing to do with love
 They are works of love
 They are the evidence
 of that love of God
 in our hearts
 that is borne
 by the tree
 that has the roots down into the water of God's refreshing grace and love
 And
 the mystical heights of Christian devotion
 ought never to be separated from the realities
 of Christian service
 The
 there was a hymn in the old InterVarsity hymnal
 a hymn that I love v very much
 Talks about how we go with Jesus through the desert
 and through
 the sufferings
 And
 its very last verse is
 READ he who in his hour of sorrow
 bore the curse alone
 trod where he had gone
 He and I
 in that bright glory
 one deep joy shall share
 Mine
 to be forever with him
 His
 that I am there READ
 My friends
 in the wonder of God's love
 He's pleased with you
 God who looked at his own Son
 and his heart rejoiced
 His heart rejoices this morning
 In your praise
 In your worship
 In the service of your hands
 In the love of your heart
 Shall we pray
 Our heavenly Father
 we annot find words to express our love for you
 because we are overwhelmed by your love for us
 Lord Jesus
 how may we speak to you
 of that which you give to us
 Spirit of God
 how we praise you
 that when we do not know what to pray as we should
 you make intercession for us
 And o Lord
 receive we pray this morning
 the incense of our love for you

 that this should be just a passing emotion in our hearts
 burn it upon the deepest recesses of our being
 Make us Lord your servants
 Your servants in love
 We ask it in Jesus's name
 amen
 Doctor Mosely thank you

 coming and speaking to us

 we had this one
 we lived in a a small cottage
 on Prospect Street in Lynne
 number twenty eight
 You remember that Paul

 And

 it had
 one large bedroom
 actually two large bedrooms
 and the other bedroom


 with two bed s

 And my sister
 cause she's the on ly girl
 But it was a little smaller
 So we had

 we had this one big bedroom
 three of us slept in one bed
 and two of us slept in the other bed
 And
 I remember those days
 h
 being with those guys

 And one of my brothers wet the bed
 One of those days you woke up cold
 and a little damp



 Maybe that's why I turned out this way

 But in that

 was a closet
 Yep

 And this closet was there
 And it was this VOX incredible closet VOX
 And
 Every night before I went to bed
 that closet door
 was closed

 Cause I knew
 I wasn't gonna sleep





 And I was afraid of that boogy man


 You know
 And I'd be amidst the shoes
 and he wasn't there
 VOX that's where his home was

 And I was scared of that VOX
 Yeah
 Were you afraid of him Paul

 Were you afraid of that closet



 You know

 And
 Some of us didn't get along
 And it was always interesting
 that when you
 got into trouble
 you ended up dealing with a number of kids
 besides just one
 So I know of several times

 and
 After school

 Cause I went to a different school than they went to
 Uh oh
 So it's kinda like
 VOX oh

 And they can't come in the schoolyard
 Cause the adults'll put em out
 But they're out there waiting
 we're gonna get you

 We're after you VOX
 and
 and what I would do is
 go all the way around
 VOX Jumping fences
 ducking down behind cars VOX
 so those guys couldn't get me
 cause I was afraid
 Those guys were gonna beat the tar out of me
 Smart
 and things like that
 But anyway
 eventually
 I couldn't run
 eventually I had to deal with my fear
 and confront
 Yep
 those people
 I still did get the daylights beat out of me
 And
 But I confronted my fear
 You know I wanna talk a little bit about fear today

 cause I believe it's something that keeps us
 from doing everything we can do
 as human beings
 the potential that God has given us
 and I believe it also
 really keeps us from
 a
 strong spiritual walk with God
 Let's open to Mark chapter
 five
 verse thirty five
 READ That day when evening came
 Let us go over to the other side
 Leaving the crowds behind
 they took him along
 just as he was
 In the boat
 There were also other boats with him
 A furious squall came up
 so that it was nearly swamped
 Jesus was in the stern
 Sleeping on a cushion READ
 VOX Hey
 Man VOX
 READ The disciples woke him and said to him
 Q teacher
 Don't you care if we drown Q
 He got up
 rebuked the wind
 and said to the waves
 Quiet
 Be still
 Then the wind died down
 He said to his disciples
 Why are you so afraid
 Do you still have no faith

 They were terrified
 and asked each other
 Q Who is this Q
 Even the wind and the waves
 obey him READ
 Let's go on
 Well READ they went across the lake to the region of Geras
 Gerasenes
 when Jesus got out of the boat
 came from the tombs to meet him READ
 I don't think he walked up and shook his hand
 READ This man lived in the tombs
 not even with a chain
 For he had often been chained
 hand and foot
 But he tore the chains apart
 No one was strong enough to subdue him
 Night and day among the tombs and in the hills
 he would cry out and cut himself
 with stones
 When he saw Jesus from a distance
 He ran and fell on his knees in front of him
 He shouted at the top of his voice
 F What do you want with me Jesus F
 Son of the Most High God
 F Swear to God that you won't torture me F
 for Jesus had said to him
 Q Come out of this man
 you evil spirit Q
 Then Jesus asked him
 What is your name
 Q My name is legion Q
 he replied
 Q for we are many Q
 And he begged Jesus again and again
 not to send them out into the area
 A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside
 The demons begged Jesus
 Q send us among the pigs
 He gave them permission
 came out and went into the pigs
 aa The herd about two thousand in number
 rushed down the steep bank into the lake
 and were drowned
 Those tending the pigs ran off
 and reported this in the town
 and countryside
 And the people went out to see what had happened
 When they came to Jesus
 They saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons
 Sitting there
 dressed in his right mind
 And they were afraid
 Those who had seen it told the people what had happened
 T what had happened to the demon possessed man
 and he told about the pigs
 as well
 Then the people MRC began to plead with Jesus MRC
 to leave their region READ
 P and I'm gonna stop right there P
 You know
 the disciples were afraid
 They were terrified
 Of what had happened in the boat
 You know what it's like to be terrified
 Have you ever been terri fied
 I mean that's a pretty scary thing
 especially if you've experienced it
 Maybe you were in a car wreck one time
 we were going sixty miles an hour
 and we're going down the freeway
 trailor truck hits his brakes
 he s
 he's
 I thought he's coming through us
 another person smashes us
 glass is flying everywhere
 and I'm saying Lord take me quickly
 I was scared to death
 We ended up in the middle of the median
 h
 and
 I had to crawl out through a window
 I was terrified
 I know that feeling
 That's what the disciples were feeling at that time
 they were terrified
 They didn't understand
 What was going on
 And then we see the demon possessed man
 He was um
 really
 think about how possessed he really was
 He was strong enough to break irons
 Yep
 that were on his feet
 And he cried out in the evening
 and cut himself with stones
 I mean he was a pretty wild guy

 He gave him back his sanity
 He gave him back his mind
 And the people came out to see what had happened
 cause they heard about the pigs
 And they came out it says
 they were afraid too
 They were afraid
 Just like the disciples were afraid
 They were afraid
 and they asked Jesus
 to leave
 the region
 You know it's amazing but
 that fear
 because they didn't understand
 And they wanted to control
 the situation
 You know fear is o crippling
 XX
 I mean it just knocks on our door
 Every single day we get up
 it knocks on our door
 Amen
 We all have different fears
 it kind of pulls us in
 it entraps us
 It keeps us from moving
 We become immobile
 And that truly is
 what was happening
 to the people
 Their response was
 Q no thi
 this is incredible
 This is the son of God
 Look at the great miracle that he's performed
 He's given this man peace
 He's given this man sanity
 He's given this man life again
 And we're grateful to you Jesus
 We're happy Jesus
 We're excited about what you're doing here
 SHOUT please stay with us
 forever
 we'll feed you
 We'll become your friends
 We'll pray with you we'll learn from you SHOUT Q

 wrong
 Q Jesus
 you just need to leave our region Q
 Cause they were afraid
 Mhm
 Because they MRC didn't understand MRC
 And they were no longer in control
 But Jesus
 was in control
 They realized
 no other man
 could possibly do
 That there was something different about Jesus
 That's right
 But their fear kept them from finding out exactly who Jesus was
 Does your fear keep you from knowing exactly who Jesus is
 Does your fear keep you from a radical relationship with God
 Does it keep you from a personal relationship with God
 More than just going to church on Sunday
 going to a mid week service
 or
 even going to Bible talks
 Or group discussions
 Or one on one study
 Does your fear keep you from that radical personal relationship with God
 XX
 deep personal relationships with one another
 You know the world is an interesting place
 We all crave that
 Don't we
 we're looking for friendship

 C
 Craig was
 Greg was
 PAR I always get those two mixed up
 You look so much arike like yeah PAR

 when we were in the middle of the snow storm
 he decided
 and the g and and the and the brothers in that apartment
 So he went around the building
 which f in itself is crazy

 Yeah
 How many times have you done that in your life
 m_it's crazy
 It's out of the
 Maybe a little bit insane
 But anyway
 knocking on doors
 he said it was amazing
 I could hear people there
 but they wouldn't come to the door
 And then there were others he knocked on
 but they wouldn't open the door
 Then there were others

 VOX Just t
 to see who was there



 who opened their door
 and went to the service
 and it changed their lives
 But fear
 keeps us from those personal relationships
 with one another
 We're so concerned about
 what everybody else thinks
 What's someone gonna think
 What is someone gonna think
 That I don't do these things anymore
 Jeez
 to learn about Jesus
 And to study the Bible
 See we're so concerned
 and that fear robs us
 of that deep personal relationship with God
 and that deep personal relationship with one another
 We all experience it
 It keeps us
 fear keeps us from changing our lives

 Fear keeps us from changing the world
 needed to overcome their fears
 In order that they might have that radical relationship with God
 The disciples needed to overcome their fears
 in order to have a deep personal relationship with one another
 The disciples
 needed to overcome
 their fears
 in order to
 change their lives
 The disciples
 in order to change the world
 And if we go back and we examine the Gospels
 very clearly
 that all the time that Jesus spent with them
 they were afraid
 Peter was afraid
 Thomas was afraid
 They were many many times afraid
 But they
 they understood
 the only way they would overcome their fear
 would be
 through Jesus Christ
 Because the Lord had many challenging times
 in his life
 Where fair
 Where fear
 could be the dominant factor
 That could take away
 his relationship
 with God
 Amen
 You know I was
 thinking about fear
 And I guess that

 two or three hundred people
 Yeah

 But I really wanna overcome my fears

 deeper and deeper with the Lord
 I wanna get deeper and deeper with you
 I wanna get d
 and I wanna be able to change the world

 outside of the Bible

 Cause the guy blows my mind
 He blows my
 for what he believed
 He died to see justice
 equality
 peace
 He died for that
 And I'm thinking
 He is willing to MRC drink that cup MRC
 He was afraid many times
 but he pushed through his fears
 In order to succeed and have victory
 For himself
 and for the people
 that were around him
 The Black nation of America
 You know we need to learn
 The first point is to face our fears
 In order to overcome our fears
 we must face our fears
 Amen
 I w
 to spend a lot of time with my brother
 and just to talk
 And and as we were talking
 his fears
 What he was afraid of
 In becoming a disciple
 In becoming a Christian
 And it brought me back
 to the time when I was studying the Bible
 And I remember all of the fears that were in my life
 in c in in making a decision
 to follow Christ
 You know I can remember the fear of
 they all wanna take my money

 I worked hard for my money
 I was concerned about this
 MRC POUND cultic organization MRC
 You know
 My wife would write a check for ten dollars
 They would take my money
 Right Paul
 Yeah

 as you can see


 Well as you can see

 Still got one
 Maybe it needs to change some
 I was afraid that
 F I'd be robbed of my individuality
 I'd be robbed of my independence and my free will F
 Well let me tell you
 I'm plenty independent

 And I have f a free will to choose and pick
 what I want to do with my life
 is to overcome my fears
 and give my life
 to Jesus Christ
 But we must face our fears
 Ask yourselves
 why are you afraid
 Think about your own fears
 Think about your own personal fears
 inside your life
 The deep ones
 But the deep deep truths in your heart
 Cause each one of us
 that we're very fearful about
 Ask yourself
 Why am I afraid

 We need to ask ourselves that question
 it comes up
 Because in that way
 confronting our fears
 It will give us
 a measure of success
 It doesn't mean we've done it yet
 but when we bring it up
 It will give us a measure of success
 Not the total victory
 but a small measure to understand
 where we're really at
 You know
 the thing about fears
 The more we attempt to ignore or repress them
 the more we multiply the conflict inside
 You know when you're afraid to deal with something
 and then all of a sudden

 And the longer that fear goes
 the more it multiplies
 till it gets to the point where it totally immobilizes you
 Right
 Till you become
 totally
 unable to move
 You become stymied
 Mm
 Still
 And we know as human beings
 just like nature
 if we're not growing
 we're dying
 starts to eat away
 at you
 You know the great thing about bringing your fears up too
 Is that when you bring your fears up
 what we find out many times
 is that they're more imaginary
 than they are real
 I need to talk to Windham
 about this
 It's like
 And then I start



 Yeah
 Right
 Then
 he's gonna say that and
 he's gonna be in my face and
 And I'm like
 and then I go and I talk to him
 I muster up
 PAR which is m our second point
 That isn't anything like I thought
 VOX What a fool VOX

 that I would think those things
 See because a lot of times our fears
 really are
 imaginary
 See
 fear
 really involves the misuse of our imagination
 Yeah that's right
 You know when you're talking about being a disciple
 and you hear these incredibly VOX hard sermons VOX
 And I do preach a few hard sermons
 No
 I thought I'd give you a break

 Maybe I needed a break
 But really
 we we and you hear these A incredibly hard sermons A
 F A VOX well what do they mean about this
 and what do they mean about that
 Oh ho ha oh ha VOX A F
 and I'd be like
 F VOX Oh
 Who is this man
 Oh I can't believe he said that VOX F

 I'd be sharing
 VOX Boy
 I hope he doesn't preach that and
 I hope he doesn't say this and
 I hope he doesn't say that VOX

 See and we


 you know what I mean
 our imagination runs wild
 P See
 the misuse of our imagination
 as opposed to the positive
 You could use that imagination
 in a great positive way
 to give you courage P
 And that's really my second point
 we really need to
 be able to
 have courage
 Look it at first John chapter four
 Actually
 this point within the point

 You know it's
 it was really pretty straightforward this morning

 And
 y z
 I thought you did a good job all the way through
 I mean you were on top of what you were scanning

 should've kept that one Horizon
 Why did you switch em
 Well

 looking at something
 I would get
 But

 and
 part of it to provide a good service
 Yeah
 Well
 that that
 I guess that's one reason the two eight's kind of
 well
 I mean when we're on ten
 so you really want your arrivals on the right
 When you're landing two eight
 then you can get departures off of
 Yeah
 So
 but
 boy
 sure doesn't hurt them to taxi any
 A number one service

 Yeah
 every one of em came
 they're right by the gate
 Everyone
 even one or
 and they said w
 and they
 we'd like the left
 if it becomes available


 So
 There's sh
 Um
 Traffic Watch Eight we discussed
 So radar service ter minated

 or
 You wanna say Q radar service terminated
 Report back inbound Q
 Or
 I I think that something a little ttle more like that's better
 he's kinda
 Left hanging
 And you could just say
 radar service terminated
 and then he'll
 he'll either come back and say
 Or I'll call you back inbound
 Okay
 But
 and
 Along with that
 Let TC
 do more of the work for you
 Okay
 you know
 Um
 just tell her what you want her to do
 I was thinking of a couple instances
 Okay
 I was thinking that for my rundowns
 you know that would
 that's
 that would have been a help
 on the other s the other hand
 I wanna get it on tape

 Did you hear that



 The problem with doing rundowns
 Yeah
 Yeah
 pretty far over to the left there
 Um
 I would
 I'm just working at
 doing as much of these other things as I possibly can
 Because they'll be times when I won't have a TC
 and just
 just challenging myself

 Um
 other than
 that I should have used her for that I didn't
 Depending on who your
 they d
 And sometimes that is p
 If you just
 if you just
 all you have to do is stand up
 and look out the window
 and talk
 You no other w
 or ARTS functions
 That really is nice
 It it really helps
 the situation
 Mhm
 So
 but
 Right now

 I don't think there was
 just a couple that I switched to the left
 p
 probably two or three
 and so there was that
 I didn't have any ARTS entries
 you know

 Yeah
 I mean I was able to k
 Yeah
 there wasn't really nothing much to do

 So
 But there could be
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I told her to do my VFR guys
 h Yeah
 And

 Yeah
 Now are we still required to w
 Don't they
 We are
 Any VFR
 Now isn't that
 aren't they when they c
 But what if they've
 c well I guess we have no way of knowing if they've come in IFR
 Well yeah
 I don't
 actually
 I'm like you
 Because we do have a record of em anyway
 But
 when the
 when the
 order came across or whatever
 or this memorandum that said
 Okay
 So
 Okay
 P I'll do that then P
 When Horizon one thirty eight didn't answer you there
 Go back to ground
 Yeah
 I mean you tried him a couple times
 if they don't get the hint
 if he's
 but if you can't get him
 just go on
 United was calling ready to go
 Yeah
 just let United go
 Hori zon
 So just go on to the next
 Next thing
 He might be still on ground frequency
 which is

 usually not too likely
 you know
 He's
 from the tower you know
 looking at his radio about then

 Yeah
 cause I wanted to
 to get him out at that point
 and
 I should've been more flexible and
 But
 everything else I saw
 you your separation was
 was really good this morning
 Maybe a couple times almost a little bit too tight
 a little to tight


 Cause

 I don't know
 And it worked out great
 One guy out the right and then
 oh th
 And it worked out good
 I think it worked out because
 this guy
 on on starting his departure roll
 You know
 before you clear the next guy
 And watch out for the
 the seven thirty seven
 four hundreds
 Okay
 Because
 they'll really climb
 Okay
 So
 well you know
 But

 Good departure separation
 Thanks
 I was impressed
 And
 Heading
 Listen to the readbacks for
 Yeah
 If I know he's at two thirty
 But you can wrap em around
 There was that one time you had
 two south plan aircraft
 and one westbound
 river

 I d
 you were gonna have three miles between the two first
 Mhm
 south plan air lane
 That was perfect
 The one that I kept on runway heading for a bit
 Yeah
 And that was good
 it was real good planning
 To ensure that you had
 oh and you had the one going two forty

 or some thing

 and then you had the Metro going s
 going two sixty
 Yeah
 this runway heading
 Which is really good planning
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 less and less impacted
 For lack of a better word
 by
 these g

 I think
 the bulk of my planning
 seems to revolve around these little guys
 when I can turn em
 and that is
 you know
 those guys
 having a very fec affective part
 in the whole fan
 of all our departures
 And
 Hm
 I think they're
 they're a affecting me less than they did in the past
 Yeah
 Do you know what I mean
 Um
 cause i
 I mean that sequence was good too
 but there was a time when
 yeah an
 Yeah
 Who knows
 the little West Coasts in here
 where am I actually gonna fit these guys in
 And
 Well the sequence

 When you got
 XX
 and from bravo
 You know
 All he did is send em all out

 So
 you can pick and choose
 You know
 y
 when they get there



 You know th
 That way
 They're b
 they
 e
 essentially on their own taxiway
 up through
 up to the approach end
 So
 So that was about all
 that I
 you know
 and I didn't really see much of a problem
 Oh
 XX
 to talk about
 I'm glad
 S
 Oh
 don't always

 don't insist on always saying
 seven hundred
 If you say
 Oh
 Why hadn't you
 when you did
 It was out in the
 Well I mean y w
 it was at
 he was a
 just go ahead and say
 Okay
 for a little bit
 but that's no big deal
 And
 and you got Delta out in front of Jet Speed
 Mhm
 It seemed like you were a little tense with that but
 really pay attention to the speeds when they're coming in
 Did you see that
 Yeah
 So that
 that worked out great
 I wondered if you'd saw
 Lots of time
 For some reason
 he just used the
 Or is it
 One of those guys is usually really fast
 Jet Speed is th I know fast on the pr departure
 Yeah
 I think
 It seems like that was the one
 Um

 And he was actually floating at
 the Jet Speed wasn't
 yeah
 When the Twins get airborne
 you got a jet following
 If you got six thousand feet
 you can start your transmission
 to the jet
 Okay
 momentarily

 Just didn't wanna be sure he gets his turn in
 Mhm

 if you wanna get
 Yeah what do you say
 and I af feel like I was stumbling over that
 couple different ways
 A mile west
 or something
 you know on a day like this
 is southwestbound
 Q Runway two eight left
 And and they'll
 a lot of times they'll say in sight
 If they don't say in sight
 they'll say
 they'll
 Mhm
 but it's safe
 Because
 ne thing
 you could do
 is is turn the Caravan to two forty

 Mhm
 just before you ship em
 Hm

 Cause the track's what im what's important
 But
 but two fifty was working out fine today
 Fifteen degrees and a mile
 Is what you need so
 or less
 using visual
 Yeah
 Was the West Coast that
 was it the Horizon who said he could do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead

 don't need it now

 They got it
 Somebody in there
 Comm
 line for you
 This is Randy
 Okay
 M_bye
 was the
 this
 This was the be gin ning of the change
 P XXXXX P
 trains
 and
 car riages
 Unhunh
 and
 Hm
 I think Margaret though
 I
 I don't think we can underestimate her
 that I have known

 I mean
 Henry Wilcox may think he's in control
 And there would never be a Jacky Bast
 While she is the head of of that h household
 Whereas I thought Missis Wilc
 Was so other worldly
 as to what was going on
 So I felt that
 that Margaret is
 is
 and I thought for this time

 just in charge
 the to b
 to
 Mhm
 So she
 you don't have to make a big to do about it
 but she also
 A lot of charisma
 And very positive
 but she just radiated something which was personality
 You know
 a funny
 one of them
 was my niece
 I think I used the word heroine
 And she said Q heroine Q
 And she couldn't see Margaret as a heroine
 I think Margaret
 maybe she was too strong
 Uh
 we're used to seeing someone as the
 as a romantic
 as all of that
 And I
 Hunh
 You
 no
 t
 Just the
 because

 And an
 be
 Because
 the other thing about Margaret that would be a heroine
 is that she
 marries Henry even though all this has happened
 she sticks with Henry
 Yeah
 And that
 They would have thought that
 marching out and saying VOX I won't stay VOX
 VOX I won't marry you VOX or

 excuse me
 I wanted to know what you thought about
 why she agreed to marry him to begin with
 Because although I understand the reasons that are given in the book
 I still couldn't quite decide that
 that's something she would have decided to do
 Uh but I n
 Her chances were
 it was changing
 And
 Ha
 according to the b

 a lot of critics felt that he was
 I think maybe Forster wanted him to be that way
 and I just didn't look at it that way
 But I thought he had a lot of good qualities
 Mhm

 This is for the movie
 Uhuh
 I mean he
 and I
 he r
 he
 she described him as a charming
 mhm
 when she was talking about him to somebody
 Helen or th
 Margaret said
 you know he
 I mean Mister Wilcox is a charming man
 Hm
 and I
 I guess that's what kept kinda s bringing me up short on

 believing this marriage
 after all
 or
 there wasn't a great deal of opportunity
 for a
 I was gonna say
 I don't know

 but she
 well the

 and then the rest of em
 and yen
 Well the her
 but Henry was a gainst
 But the
 but the
 Yeah but that was
 and
 perhaps I misunderstood that
 I don't know
 I
 I I agree more with Linda
 that
 that I think it was a situa tion where Paul couldn't marry anybody
 because he had to go overseas
 and make his f
 you know
 And
 and maybe
 those families see
 who would get married
 whether they could support somebody or not
 they strongly felt that you had to have a certain amount of money
 or a certain future in order to
 end up
 Why couldn't Helen have just supported them
 that wasn't
 they
 they wouldn't have allowed that
 That's not a
 The Wilcoxes wouldn't have
 That wouldn't have been alright

 the the the
 the
 strong English honor
 that they
 that Charles had to de fend
 men would take care of them
 You know

 when Margaret
 when Margaret married Mister Wilcox
 Mhm
 What
 did
 Where did they live
 JANICE I think they lived in the big house
 They were in Howard's End
 I thought it was Helen and the little boy
 No
 all of em were at Howard's End
 I thought all of em
 XXXX
 Henry
 Buffalo
 Helen
 they were all one big happy family
 whole family
 W when uh
 wasn't it
 and Margaret brought em all together
 and the other thing
 and when they married
 did
 what was his name
 the wimpy little son
 Tibby
 the bro
 and the young girl come and live with them
 I don't know what happened to Tibby
 Tibby was
 Well
 When when he they

 conceived
 Ger many
 un til
 friend of t
 That was be fore they got married
 That's right
 Maybe they didn't live there the whole time
 and she's away some where
 be cause she is n't
 She's hiding
 Isn't it also basically a woman's
 the women are much more developed characters than the men
 And the men tend to be
 I think so
 an
 Ex cept he was raised by his mother
 I don't know that everybody agrees with that
 but
 aunt and so on
 Yeah
 so the the mo
 pardon
 the mothers have always been
 women figures in his life were so strong obviously
 Mhm
 Bu but but the fellow
 isn't that what you're saying
 is
 phy sically weak
 person
 Uh
 they all had asthma
 I wouldn't know who
 they always
 Hm
 and
 and Paul wasn't
 they all had uh
 PATTY Diane
 you're talking about the woman having the money
 and why th m a man couldn't
 Mhm
 marry the
 Mhm
 in Out of Africa
 Or may well maybe it's s second world war
 But Isak Dine sen
 the heroine of out of Africa is Danish
 and she ends up
 a
 the brother of the person that she's in love with marries her
 so they agree to get married
 because he will then have access to her money and title
 So it was done

 that a woman of means
 as
 an arrangement for what ever reason
 Yeah I
 and so it could have been that this
 I guess
 That's to me
 kind of a m
 not taken care of
 very well in the book
 I I guess I don't know why they didn't

 because
 Mhm
 yeah
 I have a question about England in nineteen ten
 Which shows that my lack of history
 Was England the strong world power in nineteen ten
 still
 The w empire
 Tha that was where
 In s
 Some kind of trade in
 I g I've forgotten what it was
 Uh was it
 I think he had rubber tr plantations
 Yeah
 a hundred years ago in college
 and that was all about the colony of India
 Mhm
 and Eng lish colonial things
 So I thought England was in a position of great strength
 in nineteen ten
 I think it was
 move away

 had begun to blow


 When
 Well that's what I'm trying to think of
 well close to that
 w

 they
 The
 Mhm
 what was it
 the
 her son came in
 Yeah
 Was that Edward
 The one that
 Yeah
 the ward in a England
 such a
 Well he was weak
 Wasn't he
 No
 That was later
 That was later
 Mhm

 Well at the beginning of World War One
 in The Guns of August
 They

 all of the crowned heads
 was
 that was the last time they were all together
 So it had already
 was
 well over the horizon into setting

 So nineteen ten it just

 the winds of change beginning to
 Mhm
 did she
 That's when they div divest ed
 Well maybe
 was af ter r Second World War
 May be the power over them was becoming weak
 XXX
 Mhm
 I
 wasn't that part of the problem they had
 hold the colonies together
 I thought so
 That they had to be
 I don't know
 But I think that was part of the problem
 because they couldn't be
 Deb orah
 I think
 Yeah
 more was World War Two
 Uh
 more like World War Two
 M hm
 when Gandhi
 So the thir ties and forties maybe
 was
 Yeah
 It was kind of interesting to read these
 critical reviews
 I got this out of the book review digest
 Reviews were writ ten in nineteen ten



 Here's one
 When was the book written
 Nine teen ten
 yeah
 Published in nineteen ten
 Um
 READ Mister Forster READ
 this is from the New York Times
 in nineteen
 February nineteen eleven


 for that his sense of character values is entirely adequate

 while there his blith blithe manner
 and journalistic wittiness of phrase serves him well
 But he invinces neither power nor inclination


 which totally dis regre
 But what a different wording of a review
 It's so proper

 That was in nineteen ten



 something that
 it was ab brevi ated capital SPEC

 I don't know what it was
 READ But if his defects are exasperating
 Vivid characterization
 and a f
 and a freakish humor
 The clash of modern culture
 and modern materialism

 Well this is from the Book Review Digest
 So they have all of these little reviews
 Oh I didn't know they had that at
 that they've collected
 of
 I didn't
 Cause I took that uh


 Well I didn't spend too much time putting it together
 But
 and modern materialism
 I mean that's essentially what we're saying
 So they
 That was
 even there they hit it on the head

 The the humor we're having a little trouble with though
 well
 There were
 there were times when it w
 it was under underlying humor
 the
 The like
 like the t
 in the movie at least
 when the Basts come to the
 to the wedding reception
 and
 sits down there and starts shoveling in the food
 and it's really
 It's funny until then they have the confron tation with Henry
 But it is kind of humorous
 Well I
 I was gonna tell you of the one oth
 young person
 was a former student
 We were talking about the book
 or about the movie
 He hadn't read the book
 but not a great movie
 And he said it was without passion
 Oh my
 Oh
 good heavens
 I don't know w

 That's
 Uh yeah
 uhuh
 They are
 it's all kind of uh
 But I didn't argue
 and the confron tation with Leonard
 That's not necessarily passion
 the
 Well what uh
 NO but it was XX
 Well I think it
 Look at Margaret's uh
 Well certainly there wasn't passion between Henry and Margaret
 Yeah there was
 but
 Strong
 I mean it isn't
 Ruth had
 Ruth had strong feelings for Howard's End
 because it
 her bequest was ignored
 and the rest of the people are just kind of floating along
 Oh no no no no no

 Margaret's speech to Henry
 in the whole world
 is one of the most passionate things I have ever read
 Well I found that part XX

 absolutely
 oh I think there was a lot of feeling
 a lot of feeling
 Was this novel popular when it was published
 Uh



 that it is a classic of change
 It is w one of the
 Tradition and change
 Back then
 when they w
 Fitz gerald
 and
 Hemingway

 and
 And this book was written in nineteen ten
 I didn't care for it
 I
 The the hi the big description about the dumb old umbrella

 and did the umbrella have
 for crying out


 and the description of the music
 we gr


 Now that was supposed to be part of the

 I did
 I did not enjoy
 Was that supposed to be humor
 I I
 Or at least Helen and Margaret's humor
 I did not enjoy reading the book
 X above average
 I just couldn't XXXX
 But I enjoyed the movie
 Couldn't quite get into it
 Yeah
 Well Evelyn helped me stay with the book
 Because she said it was written in a different time
 and of course it's British
 and so
 because I was having trouble getting started
 I got hung up

 when you were reading the review
 did I get the right names
 And I thought
 all that happened was
 He

 and they had
 and they had this understanding of the souls
 And

 what is the big deal about this


 I
 you know
 I talked to Evelyn

 You know
 Come on

 No
 After I leave here today
 See I think

 I think it
 and it's getting a little f
 you know

 and I think it was
 I don't remember if it was Evelyn or Deborah
 But it was probably

 was
 certainly wasn't any of us

 He
 They talked about what makes a classic
 Oh
 is that it has to be able to be read on many levels
 Yeah
 as just a story about these people who are wanting to to live at this Howard's End
 or you can read it as the clash between the intellectual
 and the practical
 or between England and Germany
 Which is really what they're getting down to was the basis of that a
 That was something
 it can ap ply to England in nineteen ten
 or it can apply to America in nineteen ninety three

 how much are we going to take from the
 so called really wealthy
 Yeah
 how nice
 And all of these things
 You forg
 I mean even the x
 I won't say that
 The corporate income tax is going to be raised one percent
 And so therefore the g big corporations in the U S are backing this budget change in Washington
 Well
 I think there's

 That is as

 And then it has to deal
 with the big questions
 Uh the
 of moral values
 and of w how you per ceive the world
 And I
 But I
 Because sh

 If you can find this
 will you do that a gain some time

 I just I just can't remember what it was
 and I've only come up with four
 I thought she had five
 Oh
 What was the
 let's
 The
 Well the eternal truths
 at any time
 on any level
 Yeah
 At any time
 M hm
 Uh
 I thought there was one phrase in there
 the crystal
 what was it
 The crystal shield
 Oh
 And yet
 when they are married
 Hm
 there is a conjugal
 Mhm
 oneness
 that is
 something that I was never able to penetrate
 Stoods
 Mhm


 she was able to see the good in any
 As well as the bad

 push at the bad
 You know

 She kept see
 Mhm yeah
 In the movie
 you see her
 looking out her window
 across the street
 And they seem to be a happy
 They seem to have a lot of interaction going on in that family
 It's
 she saw

 a happy family
 had a good association with each other
 As she peeked out her window
 looking at this family
 But
 Ruth
 Miss
 the first Missis Wilcox thought highly of her husband
 and Margaret thought highly of her
 And do you remember when she was going to go down to Howard's End with her
 And all of a sudden he appeared
 and Missis Wilcox said
 well I'm so glad to see you
 That he was charming
 and I'm forget
 that we all have that innate need to have a partner
 I mean
 and
 we all
 we all envy that oneness
 Mhm
 And when you don't have it
 So
 I mean
 We look over a lot of things
 I mean none of us would be married if we were married perfect partners


 definite
 Yeah
 r if they were looking for perfect
 in us
 Well
 we are h
 I thought that was the b
 the thing about Margaret that I could see
 Ten minutes
 Well
 that's what I considered spiritual vision
 That she could see the human qual ities
 Maybe that's one thing about the book
 what what Evelyn
 what Lois said
 you know
 it translates to everybody
 y n or no
 Mhm
 Mhm
 XXX XX

 Oh
 Now what
 What's Hearts
 Hearts
 Put it up there
 Wan na play hearts
 y_neat
 wait
 play novice
 You've never played Hearts
 No
 Oh
 Okay
 Passing disabled
 Queen of sp

 irst lead rotates


 Always pass left

 Alright
 So this is us
 Groucho
 Harpo
 The object
 okay
 Is tr
 And
 you play following suit
 and
 you can take
 you throw whatever you want

 and the queen of spades
 That are
 That
 So if you
 So
 if you throw

 y

 Right
 Now these are low hearts
 So I can
 I'm not gonna pass those
 the f four of clubs
 All the
 y right
 Why is that
 And these are two high
 why
 And
 so that the person
 so that the first hand
 y everyone has a club
 so that they can't discard a heart
 Cause you always assume that everyone's t
 The first time around
 Yeah
 And then I'm gonna throw two high cards
 Because
 But what difference does it make if you take a trick
 Well because
 Cause if I t
 If I take a tr
 and somebody didn't have diamonds
 So if I throw an ace of diamonds

 that doesn't
 that doesn't win anything
 I
 If they play h
 And I got

 The two of clubs always leads
 I'm gonna throw the ace of clubs
 Okay
 Okay
 no one have to
 and then
 and everybody

 that means there are only four more left
 So you don't
 y
 so you wanna play
 So I'm gonna
 A high d
 Yeah
 Like a high diamond
 Okay
 taken with
 Now the spade
 so now
 because I could take this trick
 high spades are dangerous because you might
 So if
 yeah okay
 Now I don't have
 Right
 Diamond
 Now h
 and there have been no diamond

 y
 yeah
 Okay
 Yeah
 the spade was led
 but there's a heart in this trick
 Because I don't wanna take this trick
 But that's easy
 so you would have taken that
 So now
 I could still get under so
 Alright
 He's got an eight
 So you
 Okay now
 b two different people took hearts
 if you t have all
 if you take all the points
 it's called
 and you get
 you give everyone else twenty six points
 or else you're minus twenty six points
 And that's good
 Shooting the moon is really hard to do
 Now look it
 So you can throw a heart
 I don't have a club
 Now
 somebody else did take hearts
 Or did he
 or am I mistaken
 I thought ev someone else did take hearts

 Queen of spades gonna have to come up m
 id he just shoot the moon
 I thought someone else took
 No
 Ch
 So he got
 Groucho got one heart
 Okay
 So we wanna pass

 Alright
 the king of spades
 King of puppy dogs' feet
 How come you don't pass the king of clubs
 I might
 I don't have any aces here
 I'm gonna pass a low heart
 Just so they can't shoot the moon
 I got the ace of hearts
 Okay
 Two of clubs
 Alright
 So you wanna play that now
 Oh
 Well I'll do it
 So you took that one
 But that doesn't make any difference
 Now the two
 See
 alright
 Now
 Alright
 Did you just take that
 No
 Groucho has the
 Spades were led
 The f
 Take
 if spades were led
 I can
 Yeah
 I can
 So you can play anything then
 I can lead
 I can pl
 Right
 I'm thinking I'm gonna know
 who's
 so the points are split now
 So I don't have to worry
 Now the queen is the highest
 Two l
 You can't lead hearts
 Oh shit
 WH Oh fuck WH
 I'm gonna take all the rest
 Um
 How can you
 WH Oh man
 I knew it WH
 WH Fuck WH
 I just got like seven points
 Eight

 Alright
 I have no spades whatsoever
 It's really good
 Play hear ts

 So Erasmus laid the the
 And
 when you come then
 to

 This freedom of the will
 Um
 I think
 let me read you a page from Brendler
 Because it sets the sa stage very nicely
 and
 if you
 this evening when you go home
 on on it more
 It's on page three eleven
 But
 and then we can
 READ Erasmus entitled his anti Luther pamphlet
 diatribe concerning free will
 Once again
 the first and fundamental questions
 in April of fifteen eighteen
 with which Luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology
 Luther was glad to take up the theme of this debate READ
 And this is what Luther writes to Erasmus
 READ You alone
 Among all the others
 have recognized the key question
 And you do not bore me
 With the Papacy
 purgatory
 indulgences
 and similar nonsense
 You
 And you have put the razor to the throat
 And for that I thank you heartily
 Um
 thus Luther evalu evaluated the subject
 And Erasmus commented on the significance of their engagement
 in battle
 in his own style READ
 And he wrote to Luther
 READ Perhaps an Erasmus who writes against you
 will do more for the Gospel
 than certain dunderheads who support you READ
 And then
 READ humanistic thinking
 this is Brendler now
 obs
 on this
 but this sets the stage for what we're gonna talk about
 READ humanistic thinking will never consent
 Pico de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin
 The author of
 what is it
 Q I am the master of my fate
 I am the captain of my soul Q
 I don't think that he would acknowledge original sin
 READ Is based READ
 and of itself not capable of any good will
 And that apart from grace alone
 free will is nothing
 can do nothing
 does nothing
 except depraved deeds
 Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based
 and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system
 they do not appear reconcilable with the dignity of man
 Catholic
 and semi pelagianism
 with all of it's emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace
 finally views
 free will
 as the decisive factor in attaining salvation
 Thereby conceptualizing free will
 as similar to a healthy man
 for how can a person
 be responsible for his deeds
 if he possesses no free will READ
 This is what Erasmus asked
 READ How can he decide between good and evil
 So reasoned Erasmus
 Such arguments
 long known to Luther
 and many times presented to him
 impressed him not in the least
 God alone is salvation
 God alone measures guilt
 He alone condemns
 When he will
 and whom he will
 Man can do nothing against the divine prerogative
 Man can only accept the divine judgment
 This is in fact best
 And if by
 And
 and it is by the divine prerogative
 that man will

 For God alone is infallible
 and his being is grace and mercy
 This concept
 that man is divinely elected to salvation
 is the center of the predestination dogma
 That later
 the Geneva reformer Calvin
 made the center of his teaching
 And that subsequently
 could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class
 Um

 P on page three twelve
 when you read
 READ Therefore
 Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine
 Such arguments
 given his theological orientation
 as suspicious
 From the very start
 Because they originated from human nature
 Which exalted itself against God
 The whore reason
 Prefers to submit to the Devil
 Adjusts to all situations
 And proves everything
 Human nature
 MRC does not possess free will MRC
 It is like a horse
 Ridden by God or the Devil
 The rider possesses the will
 The horse obeys READ
 Well that's as clear as you can get it
 Human nature is like a horse
 Ridden by God or the Devil
 The rider possesses free will
 The horse obeys
 Alright that
 And as you come
 well let's look at the Scriptures
 Now
 number one
 we have to admit first
 v first off
 that there seem to be passages
 are there not
 Many
 Which seem to teach
 Isn't that clear in the Scriptures
 Whosoever will may come
 Um
 Jesus turned to his disciples
 and seemed
 because they were disappointed in some of his sayings
 and they were offended by some of the things he said
 and they walked no longer with him it said
 And then he turned to those who remained
 They had a choice
 Will you go away
 What do you will
 And the will
 apparently was
 re resided in in these disciples
 And so Erasmus is going to say
 in Scripture we have paradox
 We have clear passages of Scripture
 which seem to indicate that man POUND has a free will
 and that he can exercise POUND that will
 to follow
 To respond or not to respond
 On the other hand
 we have passages of Scripture
 which seem to indicate
 that the will is not free
 and that the
 and that man i th is
 man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of God
 We have to take both these pass
 We both accept the scriptural authority
 he says to Luther

 I will not church
 I will not question
 or I not
 because I understand you accept no Church Father authority
 if it is in disagreement with your opinion
 So I will quote the only authority that you recognize
 The Holy Scriptures
 And so

 When God created Adam and Eve in the garden
 Uh
 Do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good
 Now
 and obviously God must have given
 the first created pair
 a choice
 Because the whole system of reward or punishment
 is based upon the decision which is these individuals made
 when Cain slew Abel
 Um
 if you do well
 Shall you not be s sustained
 Sin crouches at the door
 If you do well
 Apparently
 Cain had the ability
 even after the mur
 he had the ability
 to make a positive choice
 According to Erasmus
 Well Luther

 I'll g I'll I'll tell say some of the things that he he picked first
 and
 he's gonna go all through the Scriptures

 return return the prophets said
 return Hosea pleads with Gomer
 please come back t_you see
 And
 come back to the the husband of the covenant
 it's the
 that you have a an ability
 to change the course that you're now taking
 And that you can go this way
 or you can go that way
 And
 then there are other arguments which are

 here's
 here's one on
 in this
 this is the
 the actual
 wr writings of the s f freedom of the will
 here's he he uses Ecclesiastes
 God
 from the b
 from the book
 READ God made man from the beginning
 and left him in the hand of his own counsel
 He added his commandments
 and precepts
 If thou would keep the commandments
 and perform acceptable fidelity forever
 they shall preserve thee
 He hath set w
 Stretch forth thy hand
 to which thou wilt
 Before man is life and death
 Good and evil
 That which he shall choose
 shall be given him READ
 Choose
 So Erasmus's argument is
 you have a right to choose
 And therefore if you can choose
 this presupposes that you have a free will
 In any rate
 if man is

 If if God has already determined
 that this person commits these acts
 Then there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor
 On the part of the perpetrator
 Because how can a person be held responsible for deeds
 which he does
 if he mself did not will those
 the f
 but those
 If that is the case
 And if
 if the deeds which he commits
 This is
 But

 we'll look at another couple p of his passages
 here it is
 READ If the will were not free
 sin could not be attributed to man
 It ceases to be sin
 If it is not voluntary
 Free will is not extinct
 Though it has contracted a paralysis READ
 How is it paralyzed
 See we all participate in the Adamic nature
 And this Adamic nature

 in Adam
 remember the New Eng New England primer
 So
 has been passed on to all generations of humans
 And so therefore while we
 we have a free will
 it is
 It's not the will that was there
 It's not the will
 that
 that Adam had
 Because it no longer has the freedom that Adam had
 So the human will
 Uh Erasmus admits that
 And then
 that
 God then enables
 That God will provide a prevenient grace
 A prevenient grace
 that
 that God will give me a prevenient grace
 which will enable me
 to move toward this salvation
 And if I then respond
 positively
 To the gift of God
 then God will extend the exemplary grace to me
 which enables me to acquire salvation
 So prevenient grace
 If you respond on the path
 then God extends the exemplary grace
 which will lead you home
 He uses a little story
 A little allegory
 Or figure I guess
 Uh there there's a n
 there's a tot
 a toddler
 Uh
 but he's got to be big enough to appreciate apples
 Okay
 Because
 his
 alright
 because that's the
 that's part of the story
 There a nice shiny apple
 Over here
 Over here
 And this little tot
 he sees the apple
 And he
 he needs
 he wants to get to this apple
 Um
 so he starts in the direction of the apple
 so
 what is the prevenient grace
 which doesn't take him to the apple
 doesn't lift him up and put him next to the apple
 b but goes along with him
 making sure that he he doesn't fall
 he just
 he lets him get there
 But he just more or less
 supports or sustains the little tot
 in his motion toward the apple
 So the little tot you see
 Has decided he wants the apple

 Prevenient grace assists him toward that apple
 It doesn't
 as I said
 it doesn't go get the apple and bring it to him
 he must go to the apple
 if he
 if he half way to the apple
 if he if he sees something he th considers more attractive
 and he goes off on a tangent
 then you see
 then his will has decided that he does not want to cooperate
 With prevenient grace
 Luther hated that word cooperation
 Now Luther's position is
 we are dead in trespasses and sin
 You see
 There is nothing that can come to us
 with this fear of the righteousness of God
 The righteousness of God
 That so called L Turmerlebnis L
 The tower experience
 Where reading in Romans one seventeen
 he read
 you know
 the j the just shall live by faith
 you have to take rea really read Romans one sixteen first
 Um
 READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
 For it is the power of God onto salvation
 To everyone that believeth
 to the Jew first
 and also to the Greek
 For therein READ
 therein
 READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel
 For therein
 Is the righteousness of God revealed
 As it is written
 MRC The just shall live by faith MRC READ
 And
 But this one time when he read it
 he said
 suddenly it dawned on him
 What this meant
 Q And this place in Paul Q
 the gate of paradise Q
 L Es ging mir ein Licht auf L
 The light broke in on me
 And what was this light
 That the righteousness of God
 is passive righteousness
 It's not the righteousness
 Q I hated that that phrase righteousness of God
 What does righteousness of God mean
 Righteousness of God means
 God is holy
 And I'm a sinner
 And I can never stand in his presence
 And the gulf between us can never be bridged
 and he's gonna cast me into Hell
 What shall I do to earn the righteousness of God Q
 So you see he was constantly preoccupied with this thought
 of somehow
 satisfying the righteousness of God
 Through some work
 Through some indulgence
 Through some prayer
 You know
 if a m m
 Q if ever a monk could've gained heaven through his monkery
 it would have been I
 You see
 I mean
 I mean
 if ever a monk

 Because he d he did everything
 that he thought would
 would make God respond sympathetically to him
 And he was always miserable
 And then he discovered
 it's nothing that I do
 It's what I accept in faith
 Namely
 the sacrifice of Christ
 I reach out
 I accept that
 as my
 and and then the righteousness of God
 is imputed to me
 It's given to me
 The MRC the just shall live by faith MRC
 And so
 this life in God comes to you not
 ot
 it's not God
 that that was the image that Luther had
 what do I have to do to placate him
 And now you see the breakthrough comes
 So
 Luther
 he's coming at it from an angle of a of an Augustinian monk
 This agony and anguish of looking for this God
 So
 he is
 after this discovery
 he is going to detest anything in theology
 which smacks of human effort
 or human work
 sufficient to please God
 or to placate God
 No
 There is nothing you can do to please God
 God loves you
 he gives you his grace
 totally out of his grace
 and nothing from your merit
 So the human will cannot
 you cannot decide to accept God
 Even the gift of faith
 It's interesting in
 in Bonifas
 in his book
 But it's still
 Where he's in one of the camps
 and it's very

 in this camp
 and
 you know
 you just wanna give up
 you're hanging onto life by your fingernails
 And um
 he said
 every day
 that
 I I prayed
 and he said then it came to me
 That what sustains me in this situation
 what sustains me
 is my
 MRC my deep faith in God MRC
 P And then he said
 and then it dawned on me
 that this deep faith
 is not my creation
 Well that's interesting
 This faith was given me
 I did not create it
 I did not conjure it up
 it came to me
 It was given to me
 That's the testimony of a Huguenot
 Inmate in a concentration camp P
 Well let's take a break

 I Just wanted to go over the changes in the schedule
 Um originally
 we were going to require the
 request for statement of interest and qualifications to come back to

 twenty North Clark Street
 Um
 but the

 coordinating council felt that it was wise to give the community
 more time
 a weekend
 two days
 to augment whatever application people were gonna submit
 so the due date is changed from April seventh
 to April eleventh
 And you can drop off those proposals at twenty North Clark Street
 Um
 the same process will continue
 but for the changes in the time
 at the time that you drop off your proposal
 you will be scheduled for a public meeting
 where you will be given a chance and an opportunity to present your proposal
 Um right now we're looking at April fifteenth
 and s
 and April sixteenth
 as the date for that public presentation
 and we don't know
 where that will be held
 During April seventeen to the twenty third
 and
 during the week of A pril twen ty fifth
 to go over how that zone was selected
 and
 the place date and time for that meeting will also be announced
 Um
 from May second to June third
 for the empower ment zone
 will be developed
 with the community
 and during the week of June sixth

 on the empowerment zone application
 the place date and time will be announced

 and on June thirtieth

 for selection by HUD as an empowerment zone for Chicago
 Um
 is if there are no other questions

 yes sir
 I have a question
 Worst case scenario
 After we submit em
 the the proposal application

 organizations being what they are
 what will the coordinating council
 when there's a hue and cry
 from those who attempting to empower themselves
 and combined with coupled with those who are seeking more power
 Who say unfair
 this wasn't done right
 according to our perspective
 or this that and the other
 that would be the worst case scenar io

 What can the city
 what
 what can the coordinating council
 or what's gonna be p
 be in place
 to listen to all the criticisms
 all of the disappointments at
 not being selected
 so that
 let's say optimistically
 there are some good ideas
 some oversight
 hopefully that's of minor proportion
 So that
 we can still keep the city
 running smoothly
 and becoming more and more beautiful
 I don't know if that issue has been discussed by the coordinating council
 um
 I w y would be willing to take that back
 I mean the worst thing would be for
 HUD not to recognize that this is a c collaborative effort
 and
 I mean it wouldn't bode well
 for Chicago to get an empowerment zone if
 if everyone were not supportive and on board
 So
 I mean that answers your question
 in that case would be
 But we'll definitely take that message back
 on that question I
 my individual worst case scenario
 and any other worst case scenarios
 that they collectively might come up with
 Notwithstanding Paul XX's suggestion
 that the empowerment zone moneys
 CTA green line
 be utilized
 effectively and efficiently
 to get a bigger bang for the buck
 kay XX
 I just wanted to say that
 there's also some other opportunities for

 organizations that are new
 in the networking process
 and the more organizations
 that hear your voice

 There's
 a networking meeting going on
 on Friday
 at nine thirty in the morning
 at the Mega Center
 And it's free
 It's it's a
 it's a group of assist and nonassist agencies

 organizations like CRCC
 the Mega Center
 Women's Business Development Center
 Small Business Development Center
 But I think that
 anybody who belongs to an organization

 that has any type of connection with the city
 it would be good to
 This one is Friday
 at nine thirty at the Mega Center
 The bank
 That's the bank

 on the seventh floor
 At what time
 Nine
 I'm sorry
 Okay
 I I I I have a clue that she gave me
 but I'll make arrangements on it
 The lady in the yellow sweater
 Actually I was
 again I was trying to reframe his concerns in the best case scenario
 you feel that
 Um
 could divide the city
 Best case scenario would be the
 provisions were made
 such that the ideas that come out
 and let them continue
 That that some reassurance of what comes out of it

 from the city of Chicago
 I think the city is
 I mean I know the city is committed to that
 and I know that that has come up at the i
 the coordinating council meeting
 continue to work
 with people
 no matter what happens
 um
 other kinds of funds
 that could be put towards implementing


 areas
 plans in areas that are not selected

 and that
 that certainly has been the spirit
 of the coordinating council
 You
 and then Paul
 I've got three questions for you
 and I suppose your response is gonna just kinda XX on there

 does the city have any idea how many
 requests they're gonna
 Do you have an estim ation
 So
 At least one

 s
 Uh well that kind of leads into my
 my next question I think touches on these people's questions
 it seemed like it would behoove us all
 if there were some kind of consensus building process before

 this went on and
 So what people are saying
 community organiza

 community

 group meetings
 But

 it's
 from what I understand of this empowerment zone process
 the idea is to really involve things on a g grassroots level
 And
 my two concerns on par
 are one
 that
 a and I voiced this concern with elder Jarret when
 last month at the

 Washington
 or Washington Library Center when they

 XX the person introduced that
 And
 that is
 simply throwing this out into the community and saying that
 you expect the community to be able to respond
 Community groups to be able to respond to you
 Is
 I think it at l at least
 instrument for
 Uh

 I think that that's the expecta tion of the
 It doesn't
 it doesn't address
 one
 community organizations

 and many are of them being service providers
 do not necessarily have
 the same goals
 in mind
 they've got different priorities
 they've got different purposes
 than
 members of the r the community themselves
 Um
 the second thing is that
 people who do not live
 directly inside
 the areas that are gonna be part of the empowerment zones
 they've got an overriding concern in this because
 as Mr Pollack said
 To be able to make these things work
 that this is calling for
 there're gonna be a lot of community resources
 s

 from the federal government
 from the state
 county
 and city
 that are gonna need to be marshalled
 reallocated to this area
 And to be able to have a consensus
 not just within the empowerment zone
 Are gonna be provided and maintained
 over the ten years
 through different administrations
 through different aldermen
 political processes
 involved
 these people are not being brought into the decision making process beforehand
 And I think this speaks to these people's concern
 that
 The
 this this r
 I don't know their names
 So I'll just have to
 woman in yellow
 gentleman here in the glasses
 there's gonna be h
 earlier that very first speaker
 gentleman
 Uh
 that you're gonna be receiving a number of proposals
 and
 you say you don't know how many
 twenty eight thirty two people that you said
 maybe a hundred proposals
 within a week's time
 and be able to arrive at one selected empowerment zone
 it seems to me that it be much more beneficial
 if the entire community as a whole
 was brought into this process
 and
 this is what I'm bringing up is
 True community based citizen participation
 would involve ongoing series of meeting
 that I would think that the coordinating council would be promoting
 would be organizing and directing on an ngoing e ven nightly basis
 That's not exact ly grassroot planning
 to be

 grassroot planning
 But they need a forum
 they need
 if this woman here today did not speak up
 Let me try to respond to your ques tion sir
 So
 what you're suggesting is not a grassroot
 a grassroot process
 Secondly
 we only have
 till June thirtieth to submit an application
 A really
 a true strategic planning process
 takes many more months than that
 Many more years than we have
 Okay
 So
 we have to do the best that we can do
 And all I'm saying is
 I don't believe a forum
 is being presented for community groups to
 I mean
 this is not being promoted by the city
 this is not being publicized as a forum as a
 I don't know
 onprofit
 affordable housing provider on the West Side
 He said he hasn't even XXX
 has not even been contacted
 and I had a meeting with PRIDE last week
 I said they're not being
 they're not being contacted by y
 as far as being brought into a network
 for this
 I'm trying to raise issues and concerns
 The second
 my second qu
 If they're interested in this
 the city obviously's got its own priorities
 um
 funds already allocated in budget
 and
 my question as far as the process is c
 are
 what
 How much weight are gonna be given to
 um
 proposals
 which dovetail into existing programs
 that the city is intending on implementing in certain areas
 and how much is the city willing to bend and say
 I will g
 we are gonna forego these scheduled or proposed projects
 to be able to dovetail into empowerment zones
 What's being said
 when is the city going to present
 its overall plan
 their seat
 in the auditorium
 or their place around the table
 and how long will they have to wait for their turn for development
 when will their interests be served
 so
 this empowerment zone
 Go ahead
 Well to
 let me answer your question in terms of the

 proposed plans
 I mean right now
 the coordinating council
 that is received from the community
 And obviously there there are other issues to look at
 for example

 organizations that may be involved in current work
 their ability
 I mean all that is getting
 is thrown in the pot
 and I don't think that any community that has an existing plan
 has a leg up
 on any one else who has a new idea that may not be part of a plan
 Uh
 are they explaining the
 for example I
 don't know if Londa White is here
 s theoretical
 at a
 a community meeting last month
 in which a lot of selection criteria were

 drawn up
 if is the council gonna absorb that into the selection process also
 has
 and the council has seen portions of
 of the Seaway principles
 some of those principles have been
 are included in what we have tonight
 Others are really principles
 and how the makeup of the zone will be
 And that is going to be handed out to the Coordinating Council
 Uh
 m m my third question is on the final program
 I think this gentleman again spoke very
 very adequately to it
 um
 it seems to me
 this idea of building consensus
 That
 if we're able to make this
 over such a long time
 That the city
 and in fact it's stated in the

 the HUD application proposal that
 the
 governing body
 making the application
 must provide a ssurance and evidence
 that this
 empowerment zone plan
 one of the most fundawen fundamental and best ways to have this done
 would be for the city to come up with a com prehensive plan
 that follows guidelines
 that would ensure
 that what's happening in the empowerment zone
 and be able to be dis distributed to other areas of the city and
 and built on in other areas of the city
 does the city have any

 plans
 any any hope of
 coming up with a comprehensive plan
 We do not have a comprehensive plan for the city of Chicago
 Does the city have
 We have
 any hopes of
 policies for development
 and we have been identifying places
 that have plans
 and trying to get things done
 A comprehensive plan

 the infusion of many many dollars
 much more than is available
 you know
 within the city budget
 and
 in how we invest our money
 and the empowerment zone is an e is an example
 of an of an area where we are going to do some strategic planning along with the community
 Correct
 we only have policy guidelines
 and when
 when administrations change
 policies change
 What I'm talking about is that
 cities that we are competing against
 San Antonio
 they've got
 comprehensive plans
 And
 that

 Alright

 my point is
 The ones that I just mentioned do
 And
 my
 my point is
 that
 it it it seems to me that
 it would give us as Chicago
 a much better footing with government
 that these things are going to be
 Well sir
 XX XX
 and considering that between now and then
 um
 I'm not quite sure where to go with your question

 Oh I'm s
 I'm sorry
 go ahead
 Bernie
 I ha
 I just wanted to make a friendly remind

 My name's Derek Williams
 I'm
 I'm with the HORN association of men
 and
 I I think we need to recognize that
 this is an opportunity
 Uh
 consensus do not build themselves
 And
 the only reason that we're all in this room is because we heard
 about a hundred million dollars
 Uh
 it's impossible for any city to have a comprehensive plan
 First of all
 And I think we just need to
 given the information that's out there
 we need to try to make it as meaningful as we can to our constituents
 Uh
 be honestly speaking with you
 I come from an organization with five hundred members
 and empowerment zone has absolutely no meaning
 to just about eighty percent of our population
 For the simple reason
 we get caught up in
 in in all of the rhetoric
 um
 we we constantly challenge each other
 and I
 I I think we should be trying to focus on
 the information that's available
 and and and meet the challenge
 And in
 and again
 to meet the challenge

 Thanks Derek

 Um Paul
 Derek I
 I appreciate following you
 Thanks
 Well see I'd've been kinda frustrated
 I'd like to
 set the record straight
 and what they are not
 according to my own understanding
 The empowerment zones
 were implemented
 under the Clinton administration
 They did not start under the Clinton administration
 They started in the state of Illinois
 as enterprise zones
 The difference between empowerment zones
 and enterprise zones
 for twelve years
 Congress never did approve
 enterprise zones
 at the federal level
 By the time they were approved
 Congress
 attached funding
 criteria
 and shifted the name from enterprise zones
 to empowerment zones
 For the record
 I do not live in CHA
 I am not homeless
 I do not transport myself
 on CTA properties
 I'm a veteran
 so I do not go to county hospitals
 I abide by the law
 so I'm not in county jail
 I have attended several colleges
 I think successfully
 they think unsuccessfully
 so I do not need the public education system
 in Chicago
 But
 I do know
 who does_( uz ) need em
 The homeless
 and people not in public housing
 Public housing
 because one
 we're getting ready
 What are we gonna do with it
 The city has no right
 would be in a fight
 we need
 to try and tell me
 what my block needs
 When my block decides
 what it needs
 and presents its plan
 to the city
 then the city
 can take its logical
 legal
 jurisprudence
 course
 of identifying
 what resources it has
 and make em available
 The empowerment zones
 what are
 by legislation
 to be planned
 by
 with
 and for
 those most in need of empowering
 It don't mention
 those agencies
 most in need
 See the entitlement programs is what has turned the West Side
 into a damn desert of oasis and poverty
 Because the West Side was planned for
 CHA was planned for
 The city has put together in a aggregate sum
 the map that is about two pages
 that shows you where the poorest folks live
 If you are an agency
 that is involved in those areas
 take the opportunity to find out what those people need
 and deliver the proposal
 If you are an agency that is outside of those areas
 then
 change your location
 do like Reagan said
 and move with your feet into the area
 This is no
 three card Molly here
 We already know
 where the most MRC empower less people are MRC
 Get busy
 Patty asked a question earlier
 I have chose not to do it
 but out of necessity
 I'm gonna ask you to walk through this
 this is where the poor folks live
 This is where your tax dollars are going
 And this is why you get upset
 because you say
 it comes in over budget
 This is where the state has roads going on
 This is where county hospital has roads going on
 So as far as I'm concerned
 if the city did anything more than what it was doing
 I would file a grievance with the Department of Justice
 to say that they were in violation of the legislation
 The legislation says that
 those who have nothing
 are either to be courted by those who have something
 or left alone
 so that they can develop
 their own plan
 or their failure
 That to me is the empowerment zone
 Anything else
 is a contradiction
 Malcolm
 we sitting in the college named after him
 he said by whatever means necessary
 So by whatever means necessary it takes for you to get gautonomous
 touched
 contagious
 in in love with poor folks
 is what is gonna take
 to keep your agencies
 empowered

 before we close
 we have several members of the Coordinating Council here
 and see if they want to add anything
 before we leave here tonight
 Um
 we have Sproule White

 Wanda White
 and Ted Wysaki

 the Chicago Association of Neighborhood Development Organizations
 from Continental Bank
 And also the chair of the capital improvement advisory committee
 Do you wanna say anything
 Okay
 I'll just make one point
 Cool
 Alright folks
 Well alreet
 By now I'm sure you're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here
 I would like to talk to you about these three items
 some ice in a pan
 water in this glass
 and steam rising from this pot
 Now
 I would like to ask you
 Tell me please
 How are they all alike
 These three things
 This water in this glass
 Correct
 They are all forms of water
 I told you there was water in this glass
 and you have all seen water boil at home
 But now let's try to figure out how they're different
 first
 is
 about twenty four
 The temperature of this w water here
 the temperature of this steam
 PAR I know it's hotter than that PAR
 Yeah
 Okay
 Fahrenheit
 Okay
 Oh
 We call it a
 Solid
 Very good
 You should g
 You should go out on the road there
 yeah

 We are
 Y
 Oh well
 I'm glad to meet you

 Yes
 Of course we call it a sholids
 The shape that it starts out with
 And what do we call something that you
 that you can splish splash
 Yes
 Liquid
 And a liquid can change its shape
 to f completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in
 And finally
 Correct
 And a gas completely fills whatever shape container you put it in
 And so
 from a solid
 to a liquid
 to a gas
 and back and forth
 Woo
 add or subtract energy
 heat
 change the temperature
 Alright
 When you change the temperature
 and that's where these VOX balloons VOX come in
 I have here
 a number of balloons
 VOX into this little itty bitty container here VOX
 everybody count together
 you think
 well
 okay
 I'm glad I never saw d Citizen Cane with you
 VOX Rosebud is a sled VOX
 Okay

 let's all count together folks
 One
 very good
 One balloon going into the little container here
 two
 Two balloons going into the little container here

 VOX Ah VOX
 VOX Oh no VOX
 So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here
 XX XXXXXX
 Oh stop guessing at what this is
 Let's have some suspense here
 Alright
 Three
 Three
 Three balloons going onto the the little container there
 Three
 And now
 this would be

 Everybody tell him what this is
 Seven
 VOX it's four VOX

 Boy you people didn't watch enough Sesame Street as a child
 This would be
 Five
 Thank you very much
 In
 Down
 Down
 ah VOX
 Okay
 And this would be
 Six
 Six
 And let's do this
 In Spanish it would be
 L O cho L
 L S seis

 I'm afraid for our nation
 Okay
 and this would be
 L Siete L
 thank you
 Seven
 And finally
 Eight
 and L huit L in French
 I thought you were telling me your breakfast
 What you had for b
 L Huit L
 Very good
 Oh my gosh
 eight balloons into this little container here
 I bet you're wondering r how that happened
 You popped two
 There's a hole in it
 there's a hole
 there's no hole in the counter at all

 you're getting a little ahead of me son

 Let's all figure it out together
 You popped them
 And we can get a better idea of what's happening to the balloons
 You're
 What y what
 Y
 This is really terrible
 I'm gonna take some of this hot water here
 and pour it into this flask here
 And put a balloon over the top of the flask
 VOX Ah VOX
 Alright
 VOX my Bunsen burner VOX
 Does it use real Bunsen
 Alright here we go
 There we go
 Alright
 but let's behave like scientists now
 and watch
 Okay
 Now
 Folks
 What do we see
 we can see
 condensation here
 On the sides of this flask
 Rising up from the water
 making the balloon blow up
 Woo
 Oh we can also start to see bubbles in the water
 The water that was sitting at the bottom of this flask
 turned into a gas
 That had enough force
 to fill up this balloon
 That's what we call boiling folks
 Turning from a liquid into a gas
 Now if I took the t balloon
 if I took the balloon off the top of this flask here
 what do you think would happen to the water
 It would freeze and turn into a
 Solid
 Solid
 But it would still be water
 Whether it's a solid
 Well water is made up of atoms
 VOX Yeah VOX
 Solids
 liquids
 gasses
 two atoms of what ato element
 Hydrogen
 Very good
 and
 one atom of what
 Oxygen
 Oxygen
 I know you wanted to say it
 but he's my pet
 Okay
 VOX VOX

 A all these atoms combine to form a molecule of water
 And that's what a molecule is folk
 hanging out
 Having a good time together
 And they call the water molecule aich two o
 Alright
 Folks
 How do you suppose the molecules in this water
 I
 I'll miss you PAR


 are different from the molecules in the water when it's a liquid
 and different still from the water
 from the molecules in the water when it's steam
 Fast
 Do you know
 Yes
 They're not moving XX
 That's right
 it's th
 but in everything in the universe
 VOX Even you
 But to get a better understanding of how those molecules interact
 let's pretend these ping pong balls here are molecules
 Well folks
 In a solid
 like this ice here
 The molecules are moving very slowly
 And they're very close together
 in fact they're in a v MRC joined uniform state MRC
 Okay
 slowly
 in a solid
 the molecules are moving a little more quickly
 Okay
 So you have some fluidity of movement within a fixed volume
 Okay
 they're a little more further apart there
 but in a gas
 VOX look at that
 They're moving very quickly indeed
 They're moving so fast they completely fill the shape container

 That's what it's like in a gas
 VOX And temperature is a measurement of how fast or slow molecules are moving VOX
 So if you have VOX slow moving molecules VOX
 what temperature do you have people
 Yes
 cold
 And if you have fast moving molecules
 Hot
 VOX Hot or high temperature VOX
 You're right
 But not every substance becomes
 a liquid
 as water does
 And that brings us back to the mystery VOX of our disappearing balloons VOX
 I am losing my spheres
 Inside this container
 I'm going to take some of that liquid
 and examine it much in the same way that I did the water
 VOX
 Yeah VOX
 Let's watch now and see what occurs
 I'm going to pour this liquid into this flask here
 and again
 and see what we notice
 Now here is a liquid
 That is bubbling and steaming
 when there were the f
 when there was a flame underneath it
 there's no flame underneath this liquid here
 N_that's different
 Let's see
 what happens when I put a balloon over the top
 If we do in fact have a liquid
 VOX we do VOX
 It is filling up the balloon here
 But
 This steam here is very cold
 And we can see that frost is forming
 VOX Frost
 My God VOX
 That's curious

 VOX Fighting over balloons
 I'm going to put this probe here into this liquid
 and we will see what temperature this balloon is
 Uh try to stay in your seats
 I don't want you guys to run up throughout the show
 Okay
 three hundred and twenty three degrees below zero
 Water becomes a solid at thirty two degrees above zero
 And it remains a solid at every tenjure temperature below that
 this three hundred and twenty three degree liquid
 is water
 No
 No
 No
 This folks is liquid nitrogen
 VOX Ah yes VOX
 Where folks can you find lots of nitrogen
 In
 oing this
 yes
 the air you're breathing right now
 The air is probably about seventy percent nitrogen
 and
 it's oxygen
 okay
 Our body takes it all in
 But we only use the oxygen
 as it is doing this flask here
 is because
 those molecules are moving much faster
 The nitrogen is warmer
 But
 VOX this liquid is very cold indeed
 Well
 to get exactly
 to get an idea about how cold that is
 let's use these two bouncing rubber balls
 examine the balls
 To let me know if
 they are in fact
 average normal everyday balls
 Testify for the audience

 You've really haven't been fed
 No

 Throw it anywhere else

 Right under the water
 That was
 I'm surprised I caught that
 Normally I'm f_try to goof
 but this time I caught it
 So
 when one of these balls goes into the VOX liquid nitrogen VOX
 with me
 Where it's nice and warm
 Well let's think now about what's happening to this ball
 It's in the VOX very cold VOX liquid nitrogen
 So
 What do you think is happening to the ball
 Is the ball getting hotter or colder
 Colder
 Colder
 PAR some people don't agree with you
 In fact most people don't PAR
 Yes
 So if the ball is getting colder
 are going faster
 Or slower
 Slower
 And that you all concur
 So
 do you think
 and the ball is getting colder
 do you think the ball is becoming MRC more of a solid MRC
 Or more of a liquid
 Liquid
 A liquid
 if
 sh
 if what this guy is thinking is true
 I will take this ball VOX out VOX of the liquid nitrogen
 and we will begin the experiments
 Okay
 Let's see
 they look alike
 they still look pretty much the same
 let's see if they bounce as before
 Well this one m bounces pretty much the same
 That is curious
 Well I must continue my study
 Let's see how they react under VOX pressure VOX

 Okay
 alright
 this one pretty much is absorbing my energy
 VOX VOX

 VOX No VOX
 It broke
 You see
 closer together
 The ball became more of a solid than before
 Well folks
 that kinda k
 it gives you a little bit of an idea of what's happening to our balloons
 so
 And we'll see what happens to this VOX big old balloon
 When it interacts with liquid nitrogen VOX
 Alright
 Rather than see what happens tha there and
 guess at what's happening to these balloons in the container
 we will see what happens to a balloon
 Alright
 So the balloon and its contents
 Okay those molecules are slowing down
 and so they're getting closer and closer together
 You still have the same number of air molecules inside this balloon
 as you did before
 It's just that
 they're going slower
 in this balloon
 And look at the balloon
 At the very bottom of it
 That's the air people
 The molecules have gotten so slowed down
 they're less
 they're not in the as much in the form of a gas now
 they're more in the form of a liquid
 But now
 The air around it
 is causing those molecules to speed up
 VOX VOX
 Ha ha
 And so
 the molecules are speeding up
 and taking up more space inside the balloon
 So that has to be what's happening to the balloons
 Alright
 Yes
 and so those molecules slowed down
 and got closer together
 the air
 took up less space inside the balloons
 into this HI little itty bitty container HI
 VOX But now VOX
 I'm taking the balloons out of this container
 so the molecules are speeding up
 The air is VOX heating up VOX
 okay
 And so the molecules are going faster and faster
 they're taking up less space
 inside
 taking up more and more space
 And you might want to protect your eardrums
 I get quite shell shocked at the end of the day
 So
 this really teaches us a lot people
 this tells us that the dif ference
 The difference in a substance between a solid a liquid and a gas
 like water
 how fast the molecules are moving
 And that different substances become a solid
 a liquid
 and a gas at different temperatures
 and temperature is a measurement of how fast or slow molecules are moving
 That's what I wanted to tell you people
 if you have any questions about this
 or any other subject
 even if you don't
 I certainly hope you have a great day here at the Museum of Science VOX and Industry(vocal_noises_glottal_stop) VOX


 VOX thank you very much
 (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)Oy VOX
 Someone's been shot


 Hello
 How's my favorite girl in the world
 Hey baby
 Who's
 Who's the girl that I love


 Aw honey


 Ew




 ho ney


 I miss you



 Hm

 I'm good
 Is she
 Unhunh
 I'm so glad
 Aw

 m




 gosh
 It's been so long
 I know

 And then there was relief
 and then there was ecstasy

 No
 I'll


 Wait
 tell me what
 Well see I
 The reas
 I have
 I kinda
 I wasn't inclined to call you
 Yeah
 Like I felt like
 Totally
 you know
 so that's
 I let
 Unhunh
 Yeah
 I hadn't told you
 But my period is really late
 You know
 we would talk
 But
 You were getting nervous
 No
 I mean
 and it's been so long
 And so it's like eight days late
 And I thought
 I'm positive
 WH That's bad WH
 to even try to check
 Yeah
 And
 so we went to go get an EPT
 at pregnancy test
 Yeah
 And then we d
 You know

 And then
 of course it came out fine
 So that's the
 So
 y you can't be pregnant
 No
 I don't
 No

 which I doubt
 Because
 Right
 I think that would be really rare
 So
 th you know what I mean
 would it come out nega
 Mhm
 Like would a negative
 You know what I'm saying
 M
 Like could you get
 Is it possible that you could still be posi positive
 I think there'd be a slight chance
 of it being a false negative
 But
 I don't think so
 where I would have
 like
 enough of the hormone that the pregnancy test tests for
 I think I would have enough of that in my urine
 that of course it would show up
 if I had any in there
 Yeah
 You know
 So I
 I I'm pret
 I took that as a pretty good sign
 Oh my god
 how come you've been keeping all this in side
 I didn't mean to keep it in side
 I mean
 I didn't mean
 Oh
 Aw
 Cause I didn't think it was a huge deal
 but then
 I guess I wasn't trying
 I think I was in a bit of denial
 You know
 then I would go get the test
 So is that all the drama
 and that was the relief
 Really
 Oh
 Oh
 Little bunny is going through the whole wide spectrum of emotions





 like what if it came back positive
 And then that would mean
 And then I thought gosh
 you know
 like I hadn't warned you
 Totally
 I thought oh my gosh
 I was even g
 Cause I thought


 you know

 of cour
 Like I'm know I wouldn't have it or anything
 but I thought if the slight chance I would have it
 would n't they love to see the photograph of the EPT

 Knowing that that was like its first sign of life
 Oh my g
 I know it's kind of

 Kind of spooky

 Oh


 Maybe somewhere down the road
 me too


 I was very


 But it was just a thought that went through my head
 No that's a very cute thought

 Cho


 Know what's even better
 What
 You could do like a self timer
 A self timer

 With you right next to it
 A self
 I'm the mom

 Oh gosh
 Oh gosh

 Yeah


 The test right there
 Aw
 Anyhow
 So how are you
 Nothing
 It's really beautiful here
 It's like
 we walked around
 and we just talked
 we had such a nice day
 We went out for dinner with Joy
 Aw
 great
 Yeah
 Oh I see
 Yeah and I have it on Monday too
 Gotcha
 Wh Jill's leaving tomorrow
 Aw

 Unhunh

 What are you guys doing
 Just talking

 Just talk ing


 We have a lot to catch up on
 Nothing
 Nothing
 Just homework
 Yeah
 Oh
 I and I just talked to this Asian guy
 um
 who's twenty six years old
 he's a very sweet guy

 we just
 we just got in one of those conversations where
 you just talk about everything

 and
 everything from Norm

 that's a basketball player PAR


 I said Norm
 instead of like President Nixon

 from Nixon

 Whoa
 yeah
 and it's so funny
 he's a Catholic
 and
 you know
 like I nailed him on the contradiction you know
 but
 and pro life

 Unhunh
 Wait
 he said he's pro capital punishment
 and pro life
 And
 well see the
 th those little en
 the little

 embryos
 They don't have a decis
 They can't make a decision
 You know
 people who commit crimes
 you know
 that calls for the death penalty
 they brought it upon themselves
 Oh wait
 Jeff
 JILL_S I'm gonna go over there
 Oh you are
 Okay
 Um
 She's going next door
 Who
 Oh
 Yeah we're gonna go hang out there
 With who wh who
 We're gonna go hang out next door
 Right
 Has Jill been

 I put it back in the closet
 M
 Yeah
 We spent some ti
 up folded
 up there high
 Yup
 Um
 Okay so
 You can't talk to both of us at the same time
 Jilly's going next door
 She says bye
 Um
 yeah
 She
 we hung out with Donna
 and they hit it off
 And
 we went out to dinner with Joy tonight
 and she's met everybody
 Grea t
 How does
 How's Jill
 How's her state of mind
 Does she seem at peace with herself

 She happy
 Unhunh
 Oh yeah
 Yeah
 Okay now
 tell me the stuff that she doesn't want you to tell me

 Now's the chance
 you're my girlfriend
 Jeff



 Oh
 Oh swee tie

 you're gonna spend the rest of your life with me

 I'm your partner honey

 that you won't tell me

 And

 Oh Jeff

 There's

 VOX Come on swee tie






 oh
 no I won't


 Y
 Just when I talk to you


 You just
 Aw
 Aw
 You do
 Yes
 Aw
 M
 Know what Rob's doing
 Rob decided that he just needed a vacation or something
 So
 he took off for Big Bear
 You're kidding
 he just took
 he found a cabin

 Big Bear Lake
 You're kidding
 just the cabin with like
 four beds in it
 But
 you know
 and he's staying there for a few nights
 So
 you know
 just
 get in tune with him with himself
 Oh no
 Yeah I think he was trying to get a girl to go with him but


 but that fell through
 So he went from like the romantic sexual getaway

 a soul searching bond with nature type of deal

 aw
 I hope he's not disappointed
 I know
 Oh

 that sounds great
 You know
 it r reminds me of us
 Mhm
 I'd love to
 and
 At Michael's
 Unhunh
 And she was so miserable
 But she only has two weeks left
 Wow
 I was just thinking
 and then she has off
 she has vacation
 h
 What's she
 Well she sounded really bummed
 Actually
 But yeah

 Wow

 like mid August
 Mid August
 Or maybe mi
 maybe the beginning of August

 May be the beginning

 No she didn't
 Like she was in the middle of studying
 Oh yeah
 Like she was serious
 She's serious
 Yeah
 I miss looking into those eyes
 Aw
 and smelling those thighs


 oh
 yeah I miss you a lot
 It's hard
 No you don't
 We
 You really do


 We do
 You know

 Just
 Do you guys


 Who

 that's a wrong clow crowd



 Aw
 Well
 give me the highlights
 The highlights
 Of what we talk about you
 Yeah
 Um
 let me think of some good ones
 Condense it down to a minute
 we said something so funny today
 And I thought when Jill said it
 it captured you so well
 cause I think
 it was just so funny how well we both know you
 Um
 I guess we were talking about
 I don't know what came up
 yeah
 you like to watch MASH

 she laughed and said
 can't you just picture Jeff
 sitting on his couch
 and watching MASH
 with some orange juice
 with ice cubes


 and Jill went
 that's Jeff's slice of heaven
 And we just thought it was so funny

 like
 it really captured you



 we both know you'd be sitting there with orange juice with ice cube s
 Only
 I haven't had ice cubes here since September
 Are you serious
 I just don't even bother
 or Or
 I keep it really cool
 it's cold enough for me
 Oh
 So you're absolutely right
 I go through like a carton of orange juice
 every two days
 Honey
 Impressive


 Oh
 you know what I just realized
 and she d
 she didn't see me
 Really
 Yeah
 I waved at her and
 she just kept going
 Maybe
 if there's a reflection or something
 What a body she has
 Isn't that incredible
 it's like
 she's evolving

 it's funny
 Or
 degenerating
 Degener

 Yeah


 Oh but di
 I d
 I know you would you get excited about things like this too
 about the planets
 cir circulating around other stars
 There's irr
 irreb
 irred
 There's proof
 What's the
 Irrefutable
 What's the word that goes before proof
 There



 I could just see myself like lecturing to a bunch of people and
 oh honey
 What's that word that


 that goes before honor





 wouldn't that be funny

 Yeah
 Wouldn't that be funny
 they looked at you


 Q is my wife here Q


 Q Oh honey
 what wor were we talking about the other night



 I
 Yeah
 I think it's so funny
 Okay
 Can I run this by you real ly quick
 There's this scientist
 that
 there are
 there they found two planets circulating around a sun
 Or
 in the universe
 outside of our solar system
 BR WI Really WI BR
 And so
 which like made me think
 you know like
 you know like how we have always talked about life being out there
 you know

 And
 You know
 an a theory that there were planets going around other stars
 No
 No
 Actually tha I I
 No I didn't
 I just
 I just thought that it was like pretty much factual
 Oh

 So
 you know that we have always thought that
 M
 like the scientist who who does it
 they make this leap
 of faith
 you know
 Right
 M hm
 around other suns
 Just by the sheer numbers
 well what are the chances
 then chances are
 You know
 even if it takes like one in a million chance
 like we have millions and millions and billions of opportunities
 to have that happen
 Un hunh
 I think that's the whole thing
 would always go yeah
 he would say that
 Unhunh
 But
 yeah
 like w in what galaxy
 Like what solar
 Like what
 Santa Barbara



 I don't know the the details
 But

 what it made me think about was
 the fact that
 M

 like I
 I'm very passionate about certain ideas


 you know what I mean
 How
 And then you're like more scientific
 you know
 open to other possibilities
 Unhunh
 You know like in
 like
 you know like you're ch
 um
 just
 Like you would
 M
 And
 it's like
 you know like the
 Oh I don't know

 That
 and now
 and so I can be satisfied
 That
 Yeah
 And
 you can assume something that feels
 you know
 really orrect
 Sure

 Uh yeah
 I feel like
 well if you also felt that
 I don't know
 you could feel something that wouldn't be proved right
 But
 no
 but I think that's so exciting honey
 I didn't see that in the news paper
 Oh
 I did
 I mean
 I
 I'm s

 I think it's that exciting
 Oh my God
 I mean like I feel like it's
 That's
 I want to go read it in the newspaper for myself
 Like how come it's not on the news


 I know


 Mhm

 they
 they circle the the their star
 they think that there's not
 it can't
 those planets can't sustain life
 Oh
 No
 From
 like
 from their surface
 The the planet's surface
 Oh
 They can HI see that HI
 Well
 like they pick up heat waves
 it's just
 obviously they can't se really see anything

 They
 The only way they could tell that the planets are out there
 are out there are
 just by radio waves
 And
 and how
 God
 I t i it's unbelievable
 how man has
 you know like

 From this little point

 in the whole universe
 we've been able to tell so much
 just with science
 I know
 Just with
 aw
 That sends me out there
 Wow

 Totally

 No
 I'm s
 Y you were convinced you were pregnant
 Well
 I only got convinced the moment before I was waiting for the results
 Like all before that
 well I'm late
 But I don't feel any of the symptoms
 But I got so nervous
 I was kind of not treating it
 taking it that seriously
 it's such an un believable concept
 So I was n't really believing it

 And then
 but the moment that I did the test
 this isn't kidding around
 like you
 No
 like she wa
 but

 Aw
 it was
 you know
 Are you sure it would have been mine



 if you said it was mine


 I was
 messing around with the repair man
 Honey
 I'm just kidding my love


 You'd sure learn a lot about me if that happened




 Aw
 I'd just blow up everything that we had
 if I was that cruel
 If you just refuted it
 If I said Q no way Q
 then it's your fault for getting pregnant
 Oh God
 Would

 You think we'd be able to


 I don't think s
 Would you
 Would you be able to look above that

 Would you forgive that

 Just let that one thing pass

 No way

 I wouldn't let you
 Oh
 Well

 So you could see how
 I'm gonna take it

 M


 Great

 Oh

 Oh

 I know
 m
 out of anything
 it would just be that
 that would bother me
 you know
 Totally
 Oh honey
 it it's

 Right
 Well they're coming out with condoms for women
 Right

 I think those are the grossest contraptions ever
 I saw one act
 Yeah


 Wow
 XX


 a physician come and talk to us
 about all the different kinds of contraception

 to tell us about R U four eighty six
 Is that the drug
 and the side effects of everything

 Yeah
 Well is R U forty six
 it was really neat
 is that gonna be implemented
 Well
 it's not available here in the United States

 Right
 are they
 are there people trying to make it law here
 I think so
 I just think
 you know
 I doubt it will be
 for a while
 Such a bum mer
 It's such a great
 you know
 That would be so great if people could get that
 Oh yeah
 Stay away from those pro lifers

 Throwing things at em
 Oh
 I know I know
 you know what sweetie
 she's probably doesn't know anybody
 you know

 You you're choosing
 I'm just kidding

 Oh
 oh it's so great
 It's so great
 Aw
 well give
 It
 Excuse me

 Hey
 Are you Larry
 Are you Larry
 Yes
 Are you
 You're the guy
 Hunh
 You're the guy to talk to then

 I didn't know if I had the right place
 Yeah
 you got it
 I just
 What are you doing there
 You're probably trying t
 VOX Yeah this is strange

 I'm putting water in a twenty six gallon container
 inside my truck
 Wow
 That's quite a p
 and I have to spray the road
 Ah

 Cause the road before you can drive on it
 it needs more
 more stability
 Evidently
 So give me one second to lock this thing
 keep the dust down
 well
 it's not that so much
 it's
 they put a
 a type of base on it that needs water and
 that just hasn't happened yet
 Oh

 So there's some chemical reaction that has to take place
 I guess P a good a analogy P
 Chelsea

 That should hold it in there
 Okay
 Nice to meet you
 Seth
 Here's my card here
 Thanks Seth
 I think it's warming up a bit here
 Is this the house we're looking at
 I'll take you down in the basement
 Is the furnace down in the basement
 What's left of it


 We had all these
 Is it a old system
 Yeah
 We had the asbestos all removed from it and
 and
 Oh really
 so that's been done
 I was j
 I was just at a place that does asbestos removal
 Yeah
 where
 Cal
 Cal Tech
 they're the guys that did it
 Are they
 Alright
 (H )
 No they're
 they've got an office here in Nappa
 Cal Tech
 What was the
 Synergy
 That's who
 Dif different one
 Cause I was wondering t
 So where's the man with the camera
 and the
 Oh I got the
 I got my record er right here

 That's pretty clever
 Yeah
 my brother is
 teaches linguistics
 okay
 and they just want business conversations
 alright
 Well
 Wow
 Here's the animal


 They took some of it with em obviously
 Did this used to be
 used to be an old oil
 Yeah
 I think it was an old
 fire
 I think it was an old
 see the oil THUMP tank THUMP here
 That's what my guess is
 And
 do you have a flashlight on you
 Yeah
 So
 then you get duct work
 Or is this the flue
 What they did
 and they cleaned em up
 So you can tie right into em
 Yeah
 So this used to have asbestos
 Was there a a plenum on top of here
 Yeah
 with these stack that went this way
 un underneath there to the
 to the kitchen
 there are there are different
 there are different ones
 I see one r
 is that one right there
 it might be
 It kinda looks like it
 And then there was
 and then there is this THUMP one here THUMP
 So you have one two three
 at least two there
 and then there's another one way down
 I don't know if you can see it or not
 but it's
 it's up into the kitchen
 So there's probably three back there
 and a
 Well
 no but
 what what we
 we want to p you to kinda give us an idea
 You wanna add a c
 add a few more
 Back
 Is that one way back
 Can't see it
 XX get this thing
 To help
 to a point
 looks like they
 Yeah
 I don't see any back in here
 Well there's there's definitely one back there
 Now there's nothing out here
 and this is where we feel we we should add one
 Is
 this is a
 gonna be a dining room
 okay

 one for
 one there for sure

 what about above this section of the house
 Well
 let me show you that
 And you can give
 Now
 you are on propane
 out here
 This is natural gas
 Yeah
 Oh good
 Kinda rare
 That's good
 because
 the problem with propane is that
 they wouldn't be able to v
 the co
 the county would probably have a problem with it
 Yeah
 I can put a
 Do you want me to remove the old furnace

 We'll not have to
 No
 do you want me to remove it
 Yeah

 No that's
 Yeah
 Well y the new furnace w would be much smaller
 That much I can guarantee you
 Alright
 Do you

 How many square feet is the house
 Uh
 Approximately
 Okay
 I have a roof guy coming about this time too
 You're doing the roof
 we know who it is
 Getting a new roof put on too
 Well I got some problems with leakage in certain areas
 Alright
 Okay this is
 this is one right here
 See
 I'm wondering if
 you don't have a floor plan of the house
 No
 We don't


 We didn't get anything when we bought this baby
 I'm wondering if I should just sketch it out
 Uh
 Two story
 Th
 Are there any registers on the second floor
 Okay
 So all those st
 all those stubs that were behind us
 Okay

 as long as I don't have to do any ducting to the second floor
 No
 They only
 Okay
 which are on the ground level
 How about that one right there
 Uh
 That's one as well
 And then the return is back here
 Okay
 Good sized return
 Yeah
 Now you're not looking at adding air conditioning
 Right
 we would like to have that as an option

 Okay
 Yeah
 if if you don't wanna do it now
 you can
 what they call
 prep for air conditioning
 See you've got the furnace and the coil
 Yeah
 and then
 when you add air conditioning in the future
 all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit
 and refrigerant piping to that coil
 So it saves
 it saves additional work in the future
 Mhm
 if you're thinking about doing it in the future
 It only costs about three hundred fifty dollars for the coil
 Alright
 It's the it's the out door air conditioning that
 write that in there
 anyway in the in the quote
 And now that's the the dining room you wanna add
 If you
 and we're gonna be making changes to the to the house too
 so we're keeping that in mind
 So
 Is this accessible
 oh yeah
 I wonder
 was this added on you think
 maybe
 I'm just wondering if that foun dation wall
 M
 It might've been
 goes to that
 I wonder if I can get into this
 Okay
 Oh okay
 Good
 Shoot I'd probab ly go with two registers in this room

 Alright

 Oh yeah
 and one one there
 Cause it's a good sized room with a lot of glass
 Okay
 Or you could do it
 you know
 Okay
 on the two two out side
 into one Y branch
 you know like the room
 Mhm
 the room is shaped somewhat like this
 I could put like one there
 one there
 is maybe
 tie those together like that
 See this this
 So
 all we wanna know is
 is that we can eventually be able to do this
 Alright
 To to get get this duct work done
 when we do
 when we do the modification to the
 Not not in this room
 XX do it in the future
 We m
 Yeah
 Uh I I hate to see us do it
 Where are gonna be your
 although if we do it in the sidewalls
 Oh we might take this out
 and we might push this out further

 well
 h
 P let's see
 that's the guest house
 Where is that sucker P
 Dining room
 Yeah
 Yeah
 I
 It's right
 i
 here it i here it i here it is right here
 you can see that
 this is the current wall
 so are you gonna go out like three feet or so
 So we might
 we might
 we might do a little modification
 a tape tapered corners
 A tapered corner there
 So we might do a little of that
 Okay
 if you're gonna put it in h this end wall
 maybe it wouldn't be affected
 That one might down there
 Because
 we might
 Yeah
 See eventually we have s
 Cause I
 cause we're looking at right there
 course
 now you gonna go out
 That's right
 that
 it's
 that that that's going out to this master
 which is gonna go up on the hill
 Aw
 so you'll need
 What about heating for that
 Well
 what we're gonna do is put radiated heat
 Okay
 That'll be a slab floor then
 Uh
 Yeah
 I that's a that's a good point
 I've I I'm not
 we were th
 The only thing is
 I don't know how long
 is that gonna be like in the future
 Yeah
 Probably
 Cause it would be nice to have heat in here in the meantime
 I mean say you do the furnace
 It would be nice to have it for this winter
 Put that as a
 But one thing you can do
 I mean say we put the register right here
 and that's gonna b
 that would obviously have to be moved
 you know
 but it's not gonna be a major change
 Okay
 And this one you may not have to move at all
 Alright
 But then that's probably how I'd do it
 some something like that
 if I had the registers going that way
 that might be the best way to do it
 It'd be like for fourteen by six

 and then the furnace
 it's somewhere over there in that area
 Furnace is
 over in this
 this corner over here
 That's where the furnace is
 One
 Two
 Probab ly right in here
 And now
 That's probably what
 that's one of the
 That's about thirty
 key
 is th is the how noisy the furnace is
 That's a real concern to me
 And
 if they're all
 I know there's pulse type furnaces
 Yeah

 That's a loud one
 Yeah
 Really
 Have you
 I've had problems
 If I go with a
 Carrier furnace
 The return grill's plenty big enough
 yeah
 I mean I can't
 and a
 and that's normally when you get
 you get a lot of noise in the house
 Is if your
 if your ducts are too small
 Yeah
 are either

 air noise
 which is due to undersized grills
 The other source of noise is th is the fan motor itself

 In the in the actual
 In the unit itself
 just having flexible duct between the unit and the d and the registers
 In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall
 it would be noisy
 Yeah
 But we're going d
 I'm not sure how it connects
 did we see that down there
 I'll have to go down and take a look at that again but
 I imagine it goes down
 and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit
 then I
 then I can eliminate th the noise problem
 Alright
 So it's basically thirty by thirty
 return air
 Thirty by thirty return air
 And this is a
 and I'd
 I would say not
 not placed
 not placed very well
 This is
 this is the supply
 Yeah
 See
 and I'd
 Where would you suggest they would go
 If
 if we put
 Boy
 I would say g
 I'd put one on each side
 and maybe underneath that window
 Be nice to put it behind the couch
 but then you've
 And you thi
 you so you you p you try and put em under windows
 where that's where your
 Yeah
 I try to put em on the cold

 basically the coldest part of the room
 Because
 it just helps
 y because otherwise
 you end up having cold spots on the sides
 so it never really
 It wouldn't get out circulating through
 it never really blows out to the corners
 So that's why I try to put it as far away on the perimeter
 Okay
 well this is the on ly
 So I don't know if you'd wanna
 the only the only other addition room
 And I'd
 I don't know if

 floor registers
 Are there
 are th i i i is d does it
 that's not a good idea these days
 No
 XX
 you wouldn't be able to put any kind of ceiling register in
 Cause you get the second floor
 So
 But th
 you're talking about wall regis
 putting em in the wall here
 No
 Yeah to
 to go in the wall
 would be pretty tough
 Alright
 Yeah
 Well I hate to do it right there
 Yeah
 But to get in the wall would be almost

 I mean you can do that during new construction
 but it's tough when you're coming back after the fact
 cause you just got

 and it's just too tough to get in there
 Okay
 Alright
 And then
 Uh
 it's kinda like a lo
 kinda a little parlor
 resembles
 Alright
 XXX
 XXXX
 This is a register
 Cause it's under there
 Okay
 the bathroom has a register
 now that was it
 XXX
 How about the thermostat
 This guy
 Okay
 I would definitely go with a new thermostat
 Yeah
 Kind of a antique
 But that's probably a good
 that's probably a good spot

 Uh
 I don't know
 I i are we doing the right
 Is that what
 Yeah
 well
 I guess you haven't really
 Other than the fact just kinda know that we've got em
 Yeah
 you haven't r really lived in the house during the winter

 And that's what we th
 if there's a

 with heating certain areas
 That's right
 so I sa
 like that b
 in the past
 Do you think it's pretty cool in there
 Just that one grill
 And then this guy has a register
 yeah
 I n I think that's gonna go
 Well
 especially if you get the forced air heating and cooling
 One little guy there
 Yeah see these aren't strategically placed either
 but you've pretty much got no choice
 On most of these
 these
 it's almost impossible to to change these now
 but really on the second floor
 This one's not too bad
 the heat the heat's gonna rise
 from the first floor anyway
 Yeah up to
 So I
 Typically
 Mm
 Well see that's what we wanted to do
 Certain certain areas
 Like if w
 One of the things we could do
 Oh they do
 Yeah
 So you can close off
 So that's how it's
 Yeah you can close off individual d

 and then the
 then it'll force the air what
 Down into
 Downstairs

 is close off too many of em
 Cause then you put a strain on the
 Cause cause then you're
 yeah
 for the furnace to work properly
 And if you reduce the airflow too much
 then it won't have enough air going across the heat exchanger
 and it'll
 it'll overheat the heat exchanger
 Really
 Okay
 So I would say
 you don't want to close more than
 more than about twenty five percent of em
 Or you can close em
 if you close em a a hundred percent
 you probably don't want to shut more than twenty five percent of em

 Which would b
 I'm not sure
 maybe all upstairs
 you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit though
 But
 two registers for that parlor room
 Adding two to that parlor room
 maybe we should just
 Or would you wanna do at least one of em
 I think we should do something
 Only because
 Because if that remodel's a year away then
 I I th
 I guess I th
 I think this thing is gonna be a cold little
 oh
 I can def initely see that
 See you only like
 the only heat you have in this room
 is that one register over there
 the windows in this thing are THUMP just a bout ready to fall out
 I mean they're THUMP
 they're not
 Look at this
 So I know there's gonna be a lot of
 A lotta infiltration
 See hopefully you'll go with double pane glass on your remodel
 On your
 heat loss
 So
 I mean
 in some ways
 is it a bad idea
 Because you get a lot of natural heat from the the s from sun
 That's right
 You knowX
 Okay this is like it would get

 The s in in
 until we kinda feel it out would be
 Sure
 I mean this one it looks like
 if we put a register over here
 you wouldn't have to change it anyway
 Yeah
 No that that
 that might work into it
 Yeah
 And like I say
 even i
 it's not a big deal
 I mean somebody just moves it
 you know
 You might have to add a
 buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there
 but it's not a
 not a big deal
 Okay
 Alright
 Okay
 Well let me check downstairs again
 Well now you get
 you've got the logistics of every
 And then I think my wife
 Now you
 now you say about
 my wife said she would like to have a register put in this room
 And I think it's kinda weird
 what do you think
 Why would she
 What is this
 Well

 and we're gonna open this up
 This is sort of like a pantry
 But it's gonna be an extension of the kitchen
 Kind of
 I don't know if
 I'd
 Yeah
 I'd put
 About right there
 WH I think WH
 Probably something's gonna go there
 I don't know
 I
 Cause that's about the only spot you can put it
 I mean y we could put a
 we could put a floor r floor register right along here
 But that's probably where I'd put it
 In fact the one that I was gonna put in there
 I'd probably
 Yeah
 Cause it starts getting real tight up there on this end
 Yeah
 Well
 let's
 Maybe on this end
 Yeah
 It would have to be
 if anywhere
 it'd have to be down
 that's not a bad spot
 okay
 It's gonna help out
 cause I
 See this whole area
 you've just got that one grill
 It's a pretty good sized area right here
 Okay
 Well let's
 let's consider that
 kitchen's got one right here
 Yeah
 and
 I'm not too worried about the kitchen
 Cause I mean y
 and
 VOX Ah we're in good shape that way VOX
 Wait a minute
 Did I forget something else
 Ah yeah
 Because y
 this this wall is eventually gonna come out
 And so
 Utility room
 utility room
 And we're moving the utility room
 So
 and this
 T
 This is a joke
 N_look at this


 (TSK)_Well some of these

 to
 Like
 I'm th I'm I'm wa I'm beginning to won der if
 Because what I would prob
 What you can do

 Cause the furnace is somewhere in that general area
 It's right there
 And you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct
 and bring it to this room
 Well that's what we wan ted to
 that's what we wanna kn wanna know
 Alright
 But maybe t
 That can be done at at any time
 you should say
 this is what it's gonna cost you to put in a duct here
 all these ducts
 at this time
 Now I don't know if
 if we can price em out individually
 Sure
 utility r utility room
 Just pu call it a
 Yeah
 Okay
 Utility room kitchen
 that back one we'll call that pantry
 Yeah
 Pantry
 and then you got the dining room glass
 dining room
 and then the parlor
 one on each end there
 Yeah
 Cause we can do em now
 But it's not any more difficult to do em at a later time
 So it's not like you have to do it now
 So the registers that we're connecting to
 and then we've got
 one in the d living room here
 That guy
 then there's one in the bathroom
 there's one in the s study
 and there is one in the library
 Or in the parlor
 I don't know what we'd do with that
 Do we disconnect that
 or do you leave it
 Uh
 yeah I might disconnect that
 Well it's not it's not connected up right now
 Oh that's right
 so it'd just be a matter w
 Actually it sh
 it should be capped off probably though
 And this is the study
 one right there
 and the bathroom's got one
 Bathroom's got one
 On the floor
 Okay
 Okay
 okay
 at that furnace

 This morning we're gonna be looking in the book of Exodus
 And we've been talking about
 Vision
 And hearing from God
 I was trying to come up with a definition
 And
 there is definitely a definition
 several


 so I thought I'd try to come up with one of my own
 Jim Larson was sharing a quote
 from Yogi Bara
 He says you gotta be careful when you don't know where you're going
 because you might not get there
 SM Which says so much
 And vision
 having an idea of where you're going
 Our mission is a goal or task which one is destined to accomplish
 Our vision
 and here's the
 you can write this down
 but
 don't use it unless you

 agree with it

 It's mentally seeing

 in a specific period of time
 It's in your imagination
 in your hopes
 that you're looking ahead
 And h trying to see where you will be
 in a specific period period of time
 So our vision for the next few years

 the next ten years
 Uh
 As a church planter
 having grown up here
 and having gone off to to school
 to seminary
 God brought him back
 And he began to seek God's vision
 for the church
 And through his own personal experience
 and through the Scripture
 and God gave him a vision
 for a church that was committed to being a part of what God was doing
 a church that was
 invested in building the Kingdom of God
 By caring for people where their needs were
 and by sharing the truth
 of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
 Our vision is
 is a direction of involvement toward a final destination
 When I started thinking about missions
 I thought immediately of the Blues Brothers
 You know
 comes out
 Q we're on a mission from God Q
 SM And that's what the church is about
 In fact
 The church has been given a mission
 but our mission is not for us to go and decide what we're gonna do
 our mission is to participate in
 an to carry out God's mission
 Because you see God
 is on a mission
 God's mission is to build His Kingdom
 To bring the world of lost people into a real and personal love relationship
 with him
 Through faith
 You know what
 does not include reaching lost people
 then it's not God's vision
 God loves people who don't have it all together
 God loves people who are hurting
 God loves people who are suffering
 And if our vision
 In fact
 if our vision as individual Christians
 reaching out
 the lives of lost hurting dying people
 MRC it's not a vision from God MRC
 Because God's plan
 is
 and has always been
 to use his people
 to carry out His mission
 And we're gonna see that
 Beginning in the first chapter of Moses
 I'm not gonna read
 I am gonna read some of it
 because we're gonna try to
 breeze through the first four chapters
 Let's look how God was involved in Moses
 Or how God involved Moses in His mission
 Gary

 is build a taller podium

 We

 Oops
 Okay
 First thing we're gonna see
 is that MRC God prepares His servants for mission
 God prepares his servants for mission MRC
 As we read in
 actually as we get to the second chapter
 Uh
 but he was prepared
 Uh for his part in God's mission
 We have to go to chapter one to get a little background
 Read with me in verse six of chapter one
 READ Now Joseph and all his brothers
 and all that generation died
 But the Israelites were fruitful
 so that the land was filled with them
 Then a new king
 who did not know about Joseph
 Look
 he said to his people
 the Israelites have become much too numerous for us
 Come
 for
 or they will become even more numerous
 and if war breaks out
 will join our enemies
 fight against us
 So they put the slave masters over them
 to oppress them and f
 with forced labor
 And they built Python
 and Ramses
 As store cities
 For Pharaoh
 But the more they were oppressed
 So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
 They made their lives bitter
 And with all kinds of work in the fields
 In all their hard labor
 ruthlessly READ
 The king
 was a little upset
 the Israelites
 who were their servants
 As they took a census
 they realized
 that the Israelites' numbers
 were catching up
 With their own
 Of the Egyptians
 And this was upsetting
 because he saw this as a national threat
 From his perspective
 they w
 they r
 you know
 he just knew that they were gonna grow to a number
 You know
 if any other countries decided to attack
 Uh
 to to battle

 the Egyptians
 and were gonna overthrow from the inside
 So the next part of the chapter
 he begins to
 first of all he b
 he works the men very hard

 having babies


 work em

 and


 But that didn't work
 Cause they st
 They continued to
 They Continued
 They continued to d
 to
 have babies

 So he g devises another plan
 He goes to the midwives
 You know the Israelites had midwives

 who when a
 when one of the Israelite women were gonna have a baby
 and help in the labor process
 Or in the birthing process
 And so he goes to the midwives and says
 listen
 you go
 and you help these these mothers
 but if they have a boy
 I want you to make sure that
 that boy dies
 If it's a girl
 And that was his plan
 Well the midwives
 you know
 this is the the Pharaoh
 so they agreed to it
 Because they feared God
 And when he calls em
 There's still boys being born here

 what is going on
 The midwives said
 well these
 these mothers
 they're having the babies without us
 You know
 They're s
 sturdy women

 they don't need us
 And so Pharaoh comes up with another plan
 It ends up in the final verse of this chapter
 Verse twenty two
 must be
 you must throw into the Nile
 But let every girl live READ
 So he's ordering his people to go
 And every boy that is born to the Israelites
 to to kill em
 Well Moses was born about this time
 And this is how God preserved Moses
 Now Moses's mother loved her child
 And she didn't want to throw him in
 And she wasn't gonna do it herself
 and she was one of these that had the baby
 And Moses already
 when he was born
 had an older sister and an older brother
 And the mother
 now when I was growing up
 was hiding the baby in the reeds
 didn't say anything about the the
 in the basket
 Uh
 she j
 she was assuming that she was gonna get caught pretty soon
 and so she devised a plan
 And it doesn't say here that she devised a plan
 but
 This mother knew what she was doing
 She b she m got a basket
 She perhaps made the basket
 Probably did
 and then she put
 what they call pitch

 so that it would float
 So that water wouldn't come up through it
 And she put a blanket
 put the baby in it
 wrapped the baby in it
 and she told
 she brought it down to the river
 Now she didn't just go anywhere in the river
 She brought it to a specific place
 Not just because there were reeds there
 but because
 the Pharaoh's daughter bathed there
 And this was a selected place
 The mother took the baby
 put the baby
 put Moses in the water
 And told her sister to keep an eye on it
 To keep an eye on him so that
 nothing bad happened
 but also
 So the w
 The Pharaoh's daughter came down to
 to take her bath
 And she sees the basket
 And she sends her servant out to get the basket and bring it to her
 And she opens it up
 and Pharaoh's daughter felt sorry for Moses
 And she just decided to keep him
 It said
 VOX Aw aw

 And so she
 she decides to keep him
 Well
 Here's what pha

 That was her cue
 She comes out from hiding
 Oh
 whatever your name is

 oh
 Allow me
 to get a nurse for the baby
 I know of an Israelite nurse
 that can take care of this baby
 Guess who
 SM Her mother SM
 So she goes and gets the mother
 Now
 Why do I think this is something that the mother knew about
 Cause it ends up that
 the mother
 not only
 had her child
 to stay alive
 But she also
 got to take care of him
 and got paid for it

 So God not only spared his life

 for
 for that whole family
 But especially for Moses
 So we see how
 God preserved
 Moses
 We also see how God prepared Moses
 because in the
 Moses's life is kinda divided into three stages
 The second forty years he was a shepherd
 And the third forty years he was leading the people out of Israel
 And in this first forty years
 Moses got the best training
 in the world at that time
 His foundational training came from his mother
 Cause as the nanny
 and that's what she was at that point
 She trained him in the foundations

 taught him about his Hebrew origin
 and the customs of the Israel Israelites
 Taught him the foundational belief in the true God
 taught him of God's promise to Abraham
 to multiply his descendants
 and make a mighty nation
 of them
 Probably the first four or five years
 the bulk of his time was spent with his mother
 And he
 I'm sure she told him that
 that
 and and about what had happened

 if she didn't
 But not only did he get this religious training
 and this foundational belief in a r in a real God
 but he also
 Exposed to the wisest teachers
 he learned about the politics and customs of the courts
 of course this would help him later on
 when he had to come back and
 and
 and deal with the courts from a different perspective
 but that first forty years was spent in being trained
 And he was trained well
 And he had great knowledge
 A lot of knowledge
 That he was
 that God provided for him
 through these means
 And then for the next forty years
 From Egypt
 Because
 in order to
 thinking
 that because he was an Israelite
 by birth

 and seeing an Israeli being abused

 thinking that no one else knew except this person that he had saved
 he buried him
 and then a few days later
 thinking well it's it's all cool
 nobody knows
 I'll just go on
 He tries to help
 or tries to intervene between two other

 Hebrew
 that were arguing amongst themself and
 and
 he tries to be a peacemaker
 you know
 w what about this
 Uh
 And he realized if these
 if these men knew
 then probably Pharaoh was gonna hear pretty soon
 He ran
 He went out into the wilderness
 After a few days of walking
 he comes upon a a scene
 where these two young ladies are herding their father's sheep
 and

 mean guys
 who knows
 I don't remember who it was
 to
 take advantage of the two ladies
 and
 and I I assume they were trying to steal the sheep
 either way

 Moses intervened
 And saved their lives
 and saved their livestock
 And so they invited him to come with them
 to to their home
 Moses ends up marrying

 one of the young ladies
 As Ken shared with us the other day
 it was a a mixed marriage

 this family was Black
 So for the next forty years
 he becomes a sheep herder
 Who was a a Midian priest
 And during that forty years
 First of all he became an outdoorsman
 He became used to being out in the wilderness
 And that's gonna be important for him
 for his final forty years
 Another thing he's
 the area where he herded the sheep
 was a a huge area
 And he got to know the terrain
 And that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty years
 in that same area
 the w waterholes were and
 and where the dangerous areas were
 Uh
 and so God prepared him
 God also has prepared us
 for h
 in God's mission
 God is continually building character
 this middle forty years for Moses


 He had to learn how to depend on God
 ON this God that he had learned about
 From his mother
 And God is interested in building character in us
 as individuals
 In fact
 God is more concerned about our character
 And how we do it
 And so a lot of what we experience
 but God's purpose is to build character within us
 And so when we're trying to decide w which we should do or not do
 something that we're tempted to do
 we need to remember that
 and we should be obedient to Him
 because that's how He builds our character
 I believe that God has created
 and preserved
 and prepared Uptown Baptist Church
 To be involved in His mission
 To be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting
 To be an influence
 to the community of Uptown
 for the Kingdom of God
 To be a beacon of light
 for those who are lost
 and as our sign says on top
 to proclaim that Christ died for our sins
 God has also created and prepared Uptown Baptist Church
 to be a model for urban church missions to the world
 And that wasn't our reasoning
 or so that we could get publicity
 But God has saw seen fit to use us in that way
 And this is not for our pride
 this is just a reality
 I'm amazed at how people from all over the world
 to the city
 or they read a book
 that talked about Uptown Baptist Church
 God has crea
 also created an prepared you and me
 to be involved in His plan
 First of all He's called us each to a love relationship with Him
 Some of us have accepted that call
 and some are still struggling with it
 But still
 He wants to have a love relationship
 with each person that is in this room
 He's brought us together from many backgrounds
 many very different backgrounds
 to be a family
 A family of followers of Christ
 A family to be involved in God's mission
 Building the Kingdom of God
 I was talking to Greg on Friday
 and he was sharing wi
 he he really needed intellectual stimulation
 and we were talking about why
 And God just flashed in my mind
 You know God
 created you to be intellectual
 Because God didn't create us for our purpose
 God created us for His purpose
 And that's something we have to keep
 in
 before us
 God has created us
 For his purpose
 And it's for us to seek Him
 Papa Joe has been a
 a very strong influence in this community
 Not because of his education
 his educations came from the streets
 And as he came to a relationship with Jesus Christ
 that w had survived
 He was an alcoholic
 Now w how
 He wasn't educated
 he didn't go through special training
 it's because
 God prepared him
 with the experience of his life
 so that he could reach out to other people who are going through the same experience
 So you can't say well I don't have an education
 Or I don't
 You have to know that whatever God has given you
 Whatever experience that God has brought you through
 That He wants to use it
 To reach people
 for His Kingdom
 The second thing I want us to know
 from this st story of Moses
 is that God reveals His mission to His servants
 The first that God prepares His servants for His mission
 the second is that God reveals His mission to His servants
 We have to go to Exodus three
 and see how God gets Moses's attention

 No Doris feeds him

 Feed him

 But
 No
 Well I know


 he come and didn't have a lunch

 But all winter she fixes him lunch
 cause they're always close enou gh to

 Because it's
 No lemon
 N_that's al right

 Soon as I sat it down

 Just
 It
 X
 There's not enough lemon there to bother me
 But it tastes so good with lemon in it
 I don't even like ice tea
 Do you like hot tea

 But the winter hasn't bl asted cold enough for me yet
 L Moi L
 Or L toi L
 Well I answer ed
 I assu med it was me
 And the hot tea


 I get it
 I get it

 I don't put lemon i n my hot tea
 You ever do
 I only do when I have a sore throat
 I usually d have
 Yeah
 Lemon
 or lemon and honey is good
 Now you won't be able to touch Jonathan

 Just don't tell him
 Because you're drinking lemon and honey


 She's got a sore throat
 Oh
 Well
 Don't tell him
 or don't tell Carolyn
 Yeah XX
 And
 Just don't tell him
 sick Barbara Jean was


 Marth a Jean

 Well
 Cause
 I loved the little bit about the potty training

 She t old me the story of how
 she trained all her kids by nine months
 I'd
 Well what was it
 Now it's gotten back to eight

 the boys weren't but
 They only
 Who
 who was it that s

 That said that
 that's not potty training
 Doc tor Spock
 Doctor Spock
 How about Captain Kirk

 No no Sherry
 You're an idiot




 She's trying

 It's Mister Spock
 and Cap
 and Doc tor Spock
 Well
 what was her story about Barb
 That everyone
 That was
 She was in the hospital three times
 With asth matic bronchitis
 With bron
 And so
 Well
 I
 For some reason
 because she was so worried about Jonathan
 like oh
 And then she told her that
 She did n't have what
 We'are all going
 Barb didn't outgrow it
 Mm
 Oh
 yeah because C
 oh boy

 XXXX XX
 Way to go Caro lyn

 Well isn't she healthy
 Mhm
 I mean
 she
 S
 I know she ha s
 she has something wrong with her gall bladder
 heart trouble and
 Her
 She has an enlarged heart
 Oh lots of people have VOX that
 And she'd bad back
 and she's always
 always using nose spray

 Maybe she's
 Alw
 Maybe she's addicted
 a semi hypochondriac
 Maybe there's coke in it
 I think that that's closer to the truth
 I think you're righ t

 I always ha ve
 get backaches
 It see ms to me
 I think I get backaches because
 I mean some people's bodies are built a certain way
 just don't take care of it
 and be cause

 and the world is built for women who are about five five
 It's
 And it's
 And bec ause you're
 The bo dy is not
 It's cause of the way my body is
 the human body
 Because y
 The human bod backbone
 Oh
 for an animal to walk on two f eet
 So if you were
 That's basic ally
 Actually
 Really
 Is to get down on your hands and knees
 and walk arou
 not crou
 Not all the way down though
 H unh
 It hurt
 but then your back's gets sway back
 N but
 th
 No if you
 If you just s tand there it will
 you know
 you keep it
 Yeah
 Well
 when I
 I asked
 when I went in with my arm
 you know
 cause I had tr so much trouble with my elbow
 And
 so
 while she was giving me the treatment one time
 and she said the l
 The newest theory is the opposite
 We
 They used to say
 that you lie flat
 Oh
 with your e
 Yeah
 So that it will curve this way
 So that it curves this way
 She says now we're having em do
 exercises
 Arching
 and you lift your shoulders up
 And then you keep doing it
 until you can have your hands totally straight
 and your hips on the
 I mean your arms totally straight
 Yeah
 So I started doing that
 that
 But I can't
 and he couldn't
 He was walking stooped over
 his back hurt so bad
 You have to
 You star t out real
 We put four pillows under his knees

 But you see
 Hm
 then that's what you
 different people have different ty kinds
 Well and it was probably just from being sick
 That caused it
 I am conc
 Carolyn thinks she's got a kid ney infection
 P Oh my God P

 Carolyn's al
 Carolyn's almost as bad as Barb
 but
 She just has these little things that come every once in a while and they're always serious
 Well she's got a pain
 at at her waist
 and she's not
 going to the bathroom as often as she should

 She's gonna get fat
 Water bloating
 she's gonna get bloated
 It's different than fat
 WH No it isn't the same thing WH
 Looks like


 Oh I know
 once it's

 looked at her and thought it was just a muscle spasm
 So they gave her some
 He
 He or she got a some pills for muscle spasms

 Because they told Marleen
 Well
 the
 you know
 Yeah that's what we always thought too
 yeah that's what we thought
 where
 they tol

 They told her they were

 And
 here
 That's weird
 Hm
 Hm
 I think
 I know that

 Cause I always thought they were just below your waist
 Anyway
 But there are


 Yeah all sorts of j unk in there anyhow
 kinda
 which we don't need

 Well she thought she had a bladder infection
 Oh did she
 Why

 well they're kinda related aren't they

 But
 It's just mo ving through her system
 But they did n't even do a urinalysis
 Which I think is ridiculous
 When she went in yesterday
 S
 But will a urine sh ow kidneys
 Sure
 Oh I didn't know it would
 I guess it would
 they thought he had a kidney
 He had had pneumonia
 Eventually
 The first week he
 He had a vi
 I
 I thought it
 Or either that or the
 He had pneumonia
 Yeah
 he eventually developed it
 No
 He's had it before
 XX
 When he was real little
 When he was
 Hey
 So
 VOX now Bill and Jonathan are a natural class
 But he outgrew it when he was five too
 A little older than five


 to see his grandmother


 He used to have asthma attacks
 Oh
 That's a drag

 Or was it the cl
 Oh oh

 His mom said it was

 She said she
 They went every
 just about every weekend
 His mom
 Which f g
 It was Jack's mother
 Mhm
 Hmm
 That's
 pretty ba d
 But he outgrew it
 But
 it scared Marleen
 cause that was one of her dad's problems
 One WH of her dad's problems WH
 Asthma
 Oh

 And there's diabetes in our family
 Maybe they picked something up in a blood test somewhere
 There must be some
 Oh
 Her

 But
 right before she got pregnant
 N
 Well
 So
 it could be that they're
 And then there's

 And there's such a thing as pregnancy diabe tes
 Where you don't have it any other time
 And
 and then
 Hm
 That's pr etty weird

 But Grandmom did
 Oh

 Were you big
 When you were born
 Seven thirteen
 so she didn't have one of those classic signs of diabetes
 y f usually don't on your f irst baby

 Yeah yeah

 Anyway
 living in New Jersey
 in nineteen forty one

 I graduated in high school in nineteen forty one
 I went to work in a steel mill
 And

 lo and behold
 And I went to my father
 kids always
 w
 I said to my father

 He
 absolutely
 was
 so incredibly upset I couldn't believe this

 Because

 in the three twe
 Ah
 up through the Meuse
 and the
 M the Rainbows
 then the Argon

 was sort of out of the question
 And you were on ly eighteen

 Well I was probably seventeen maybe

 Mm
 one day
 I
 They will take me into this acadamy
 they'll train me
 Well
 after the last dog was hung
 that
 that the highest casualties in the war were the merchant service
 Yeah
 but
 Yeah

 So
 Yeah
 No big deal
 Yeah
 I sailed
 I sailed off to the war

 Unhunh
 in the merchants
 And and and and I stayed
 I st
 I
 I stayed
 my first trip was around the world out to the Middle East


 I was involved in
 I was second mate in a ship at the
 We made twelve trips from Southampton to the beaches
 and then they sent us home
 and then I came back into Italy
 and we went across the
 the Atlantic and Pacific
 And so I stayed in the merchant marines for another year or two
 and then I went to college at
 University of Pennsylvania
 and then
 Where my f ather went
 Hm
 Good school
 P Went to school P
 Uh

 um
 I was more interested in
 in reliving my youth
 anyway
 make a make a long story short
 Sort of get a holding of it

 M

 in forty nine
 I

 and went to
 South Africa


 On the Af rican Queen
 I
 With uh
 Pilgrim
 I thought
 I thought you were there with
 actually was a two h
 wi y
 Was a two hatched
 y i it was a it was a story
 But she was a real ship
 based in
 in

 in

 So I sailed on her for a little while
 U m
 and then in fifty
 Uh guy named Near
 Now let me stop you now
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Yeah
 since you're of re cord

 when you say you were sailing now
 what were you doing during these different phases of your sailing life
 You were second mate then
 Okay
 Alright
 Yeah
 Pf


 Hi


 He's st

 You just didn't want to
 think he might've fallen over the fence

 Anyway I was sailing second mate in the Pilgrim

 this was American South African lines

 and and
 in forty nine
 I got sort of fussy with that
 the purser was a guy named Bob Heins
 he and I decided that
 well we'd sort of wanna do something more adventuresome
 so we we jumped ship in New York
 paid off
 And we took a passage in the America
 and went to Paris
 I stayed in Paris for seven eight or nine months
 My friend Bob Heins stayed for twenty years
 Ah
 He he sort of got hooked on that
 He g ot
 He he under stood what was r

 went to work and
 He knew what was
 He figured it out
 He knew what the hell this world is all about
 He figured it out
 XX
 Figured it out
 So uh I had a lot of interesting adventures there
 And finally

 I wrote home to my family and said
 would you be kind enough to

 And they did
 Well
 Ah
 I was then twenty five years old


 I took it down to the A merican

 to the US Lines and I cashed it
 Right
 So I stayed on that for another month or two
 And then I wrote home and said
 gee I'm
 they sent it sent it to me
 and this time when I went down to WH American Expre WH


 to US Lines and they said
 well there's a hold on this




 I said
 So anyway
 I sailed home in the old Isle de France
 Uh
 got into New York
 and we popped in and it was
 and a little tensy
 went home
 my m grandma was there
 and n dinner was served
 Q well tell me

 Mhm





 Right
 yeah
 Yeah
 Anyway
 Very good
 Very good
 I went to work for Grace Lines in New York
 sailed in a couple of Grace liners

 Korean War started
 I had the
 Threw in my hat
 D
 WH WH
 when I came back from one of those trips from down to Cartagena
 Right
 Mhm
 m what I thought was my friend

 I said this is terribly awkward
 I've just been promoted from third mate to second mate
 and and could we possibly postpone these orders
 My friend stood up behind his desk
 in his full four stripes and said
 F Lieutenant
 You are in the US Navy now F

 No one ever explained that to me be fore

 yeah


 I v
 Finally
 but
 it was all
 I stayed in the US Navy
 And then I was forced out
 because I failed a promotion to commander
 So
 but all that service time you put in
 Thirty five
 but I'm am p
 Twenty three
 That's
 So after all this happened
 and the
 No it's because of the f
 A nd of
 so I went to this guy and
 Pentagon at the time and
 and I went to him and said
 there's
 Because the way the law was written
 And we fixed it as of nineteen fifty four
 Instead of saying you
 retire as of twenty years from your pay entry base date
 Mine was forty nine
 Uh
 they said
 what we've now said is
 handshakes all around
 Then I went off and worked for a couple of companies and

 my my success in life
 Min e's primar ily luck
 Ten perc

 Yeah
 and


 and then one day Debby said we're moving to Santa Fe

 Over by the Mansion now

 Unh unh
 This this
 thing he's put up
 When we went on a to trip
 Uh
 w he he'd come over
 along this common walk

 and then
 we built the garage
 Which m meets code and all that
 And Jack was so upset about that




 you know me
 What fence
 And
 so I said gee whiz
 s so we'd found out that Jack was
 f thought that that took away from the
 the aesthetics to have this garage
 So that's why he threw up the fence
 we're all within the code
 I first wanted to build the garage
 sort of
 well we'll make it fifteen
 We moved a few fractions and
 Hey look

 except Polly can get right through it

 but ne ver delineated
 does responsibility exist or not
 It does
 Ah
 So we have
 I'm losing
 Except
 I

 Responsi bility
 Assumed

 Responsibility can be either assumed or asked
 Or expli cit
 There's no responsibility
 Assumed XXX
 Or it's articulate
 And so when
 When there is
 I'm sorry
 We're w e're not talking about
 what your respon s
 Her statement about

 and she
 I said
 I admit
 I was making XXX
 I looked at her chocolate
 You can't just
 Back to the setting
 I bought that cho colate

 Exactly
 Please

 But do you n don't think she has a res ponsibility to be good to me
 But
 No


 you didn't
 Yeah but you were not in the s

 in
 when she carried on

 Jennifer and I and Dana had a huge argument in May
 Which was b concerning you and grandma
 No not in May
 Mhm
 What
 I think there is a
 What hap
 Calm down
 And then
 Y

 Did I p ounce
 You said
 S uch a
 I was
 I was gonna offer an opinion a bout the d
 the d
 About the
 What was she doing there why you
 Do you think that 's true any
 Yeah I do think that's true
 who are standing there going
 are you sure that's twenty one cents
 or twenty two cents

 to hold off with putting things on the counter MRC
 Mom was getting a h
 at the checkout counter

 Just so many ob jects


 for a little
 MRC and what was not rung in MRC
 So she
 not to put everything on the counter
 Starts putting everything on the cou nter
 I w
 Acts like I'm a child

 As
 One person's order is another person's mess



 and I was trying to pat her on the shoulder
 Ts
 It looks a bit
 MRC just makes me angry MRC
 This ex aggerated language

 What does this have to do with guilt

 Right



 That was a slip
 A slip


 Where did that language of exaggeration come from
 Cause it's my disease
 Mimi Fogarty is like the biggest perpetrator of it
 Mimi Fogarty
 Sh e d
 It seems to me
 I tend to talk like them
 Well
 just like
 just little jokey things
 Yeah but that's just
 J ennifer and Lisbeth are hyper sensitive
 So
 Mom
 Lisbeth hears
 a lot more into it than Mom
 And if m Lisbeth says
 Jenn ifer
 J ennifer hears paragraphs
 So there's a long history here
 Nine tenths of that paragraph is guilt
 Well that
 And then
 XX XX

 The other times
 What Ma
 That button you gave me
 The tone of the voi
 Yeah like

 Turn on the fire alarm


 These kids were came in

 Out

 so I was moving them
 an d they were trying to be cute
 and say sweet things
 and
 To stay in
 Yeah
 Yeah
 there are a lot
 so in terms of being

 and so

 are there any oth
 no it's ten thirty
 And
 well are there any other
 That what are the other bookstores open in town
 come on
 It's ten thirty
 This is the latest thing op en bes ides ice cream stores and bars
 And
 I felt kinda bad
 I guess I'm glad I said what I said
 there's some guy came in who
 N he looked like a student
 ver nicely kept
 Friendly looking
 And basically needed a place to stay because
 he ended up in town with twenty dollars
 couldn't get to Amherst
 no hotels that were open and
 et cetera
 and he wanted to know if I knew anyone who would put him up
 And
 I referred him down to Paul
 Cause I just
 but at the same time I thought
 well that's a better thing and should we talk to John about
 Mhm
 And I also just wasn't quite comfortable
 Mhm
 So
 I don't know
 L Je ne sais pas L
 Oh the other thing I found out
 I h was returning the book on
 Uhuh
 And
 Paul
 And
 well
 and she has this place that deals with co op
 what's it
 co op initiatives
 Mhm
 And
 they s
 I'm sore
 Oo
 She deals a lot with alternative kinda housing
 and housing for the sake of people and stuff
 Mhm
 So we were talking about that
 and then while we were talking about that

 a lady came to buy something
 and
 she s gave me the name of this other
 who s
 started two co housing developments
 Hm

 and
 Jen and I put a note in the log
 Mhm
 By my the
 and she put a note said
 oh neat
 in Denver
 In like Colo s
 I think it was in Denver
 P P
 So it was pretty wild
 Uhuh
 I have to pee
 Okay
 Oh
 P XX my shoes first
 I'm so tired
 So so so tired P
 things just got too harried and I
 just didn't think it was the right time to buy a book
 Mm

 We got more stuff for your dad
 What kinda stuff
 Umm
 computer access places
 Like places you could plug into
 XX XX
 or
 VOX Aw VOX
 And I also
 fiddled around and
 figured out how I can get things to print out two on a page
 S take up less paper
 Unhunh
 You need a magnifying glass
 No I think it's okay
 In better light
 Yeah we have to get a light
 Y
 Here
 Take this back
 Be right back
 that needs to be addressed in this house

 So
 it seems like a fairly basic one
 That we could address fairly easily
 I was thinking we should walk down sometime to h
 to the
 eeya eeya eeya
 to the lighting place
 down b y
 Well because I wanna
 I wanna do things orderly


 Sorry

 Scott
 I used the rest of the orange juice
 but I put the container back
 in the fridge
 So that we don't have to wash it
 Okay
 So far
 How much is it
 It's like six dollars a month
 That's okay

 Mm
 it's cute there
 but if you're gonna sit there and read
 Well would it work to put it on the other end
 It wouldn't be as
 P Right P

 That radiator tilts
 Mhm
 Hm


 So I got to look at the cop y
 of
 it's Dante's Inferno
 Mhm

 It's a new translation
 with twenty different contemporary American poets
 Got different cantos
 Mhm
 And so it's neat
 Cause there's these poets that I like
 And they've done translations
 Mhm
 Of these different
 whatever toes
 And
 they
 well it's expensive
 And it's nice
 And it matches kind of this
 bath book
 Mhm
 And I wasn't pla
 I don't really need it
 the Divine
 I wasn't urgently planning on getting the Divine Comed
 The
 But
 Those two books together
 So I was thinking it's sort of an aesthetic thing
 That it would be nice to get them together
 At a time
 I'm gonna have a little vacation
 And then I could read
 Mhm
 I do realize it's a little bit far out
 it seems like there's
 the Alexandra Stoddard book back
 Uh
 They re turned
 I think they returned the one
 The one that I had that had the
 the blue and red writing
 uhuh
 Maybe it mean s that
 Maybe the paperback's going out
 I don't know
 Uh oh
 I can always order another one if I need to

 Hm
 Hm mm
 Guess it' s a
 It w as just a list of
 places that offer emails for service
 Oh
 you know maybe if we could turn the spider plant around
 Which one
 The one that just looks kinda decrepit
 That one
 Yeah
 Maybe we could
 would probably do better
 P I mean can it wait P
 I think we thought about doing that in the springtime
 then I thought we'd replant them
 Yeah
 but I think there's more babies than we need
 Would
 Yeah
 And we've got three new babies that I could replant
 already
 And that
 Yeah the
 has lots of babies

 Oh
 The book
 Yeah
 Do you think you want to read that together
 That interest you at all
 Unhunh
 Cause if it
 then
 No
 I thi
 I think it probably would
 It seemed like it would be fun to read out loud
 And I don't wanna start it if we're going to read it together
 I don't want to start it on my own
 I wonder if if it would be
 any less abstract than the
 Yeah there's a lot mo re conversa
 Like the part where she falls on the ground
 Could be easier to follow
 and says
 VOX I am nature's bride VOX
 Unhunh
 she also says several other things
 And there's also commentary from the narrator
 Unhunh
 gets the point across
 Simply
 So
 yeah
 Your basic account fro m Ne ar Net is two hundred and fifty dollars a month
 VOX That's a lot VOX

 but it XX
 I do want to call Jen
 Well you can call Jenny
 I'm tired
 Mm
 Maybe I'll call Jenny anyway
 Jenny anyway
 Jenny Garret
 Cause I wanted to ask her about the
 magazines she's had

 Did I tell you that the woman who does
 This book here
 L Monsieur L

 Unh unh
 Okay she did the art here
 And other art
 that she does clip art
 For different kinds of liturgical things
 And I found there's two books
 listed
 But they are clip art books
 Mhm
 One is for VOX feasts and celebrations VOX
 And one is for something
 They have neat titles
 You just need to get yourself a clip art book and a scanner
 And a scanner
 And then you'd like load em into your computer and make your things with them
 Yeah
 See then you could
 make them different colors
 and things like that
 And you could do neat things with them
 Different colors and sizes
 I'd need a color printer
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Little minor
 Umm
 you can get a color version of the printer I have for
 five hundred dollars
 Would it be good
 It's reasonable
 Look at this
 When does this go to
 We have to go far away away though

 Queen Anne wing recliner

 I don't think they really liked my answ er

 That's
 But you have

 liberal whatever
 But lately

 moral stance

 And there's a
 Oh

 Give him a drink
 It's he drinks too fast

 Gross
 Um

 Probably he was opening
 and we took him to the X
 Breathing through his mouth more
 cause he couldn't breathe through his nose at
 Mm
 And then he couldn't even breathe

 they had this thing
 and it was funny cause
 we could
 They put a mist
 you know
 and I was all
 I mean then where'd they put this on
 they stuck it in a tu
 around his face
 Oh
 so that he could
 but they put a mist in it
 so that he could
 They didn't want to stick oxygen tube up his nose
 cause he'd take it off
 Mhm

 Oh
 poor
 And then it would sto
 cause they didn't want him to hyperventilate
 Yeah he's doing better
 And then the doctor comes in
 and then they stick this fing
 thing on his finger
 It's like light sensored
 And they have to guard it from the light
 And it measures his oxygen percent
 Cool
 It was weird
 And he was all in
 Which
 Of what's
 Um
 adults are probably
 Adults are supposed to be anywhere from like ninety three to on up
 You gonna go down

 Nobody should really be that low

 And his heart
 Two o four
 And it's supposed to be
 I think he said like one sixty eight or something
 babies are supposed to have really high heart rates
 And he'd just do
 he was doing it

 And
 A shot
 To make the swelling go down in his throat

 You're gonna have to st
 muss it up

 Work it in
 Knead it in
 Yeah
 Here
 How am I gonna
 Hunh
 Oh okay
 Cover it
 S they're gonna come out salty
 Here
 Okay
 Go ahead and s and
 mix it
 No
 They show like
 they they show a lot
 XX then they don't show nothing
 How much masa can I put in the meat
 About that much

 Do I have to s dissolve it in some water
 Here I thought you knew how to do this
 Mom
 Unhunh
 Get some more
 It
 Wi
 Oh
 I thought you were gonna s
 I think
 How much
 That
 And and

 With hot water or cold water
 Doesn't matter
 The one you
 you think it spread better
 You know
 And when Willy was a little boy
 he saw that
 she had a lot of tamales already
 Uh
 in the shop
 and and in the meat and everything
 And he got some and
 went out the house
 And they were not cook





 He thought they were cook already
 VOX XXXX aye VOX
 The tamales are not cooked XX
 Yeah
 That's good
 XX
 She's so quick XX
 To make some tamales
 Right
 Right a way
 L Mira L
 L Est bueno
 Est bueno L
 Mhm
 What else do you want me to put on the meat
 I I I think that's all
 you you put the pepper already didn't you
 The black pepper
 I want to put some more in it
 You put some
 you put some
 salt
 Eh
 You don't put any salt
 No
 Can I put some of this broth
 No
 What do you think Shane
 Nah
 See
 Does it matter what I say

 Does it matter what I say
 No




 She goes and dumps it in there



 Well
 do you
 Do you want lard
 I don't know what to do with this lard business
 L Yo pre fiero L
 In there


 How was

 Isabelle's b tamales
 They ate em
 They were greasy
 Yeah
 Outsi outside the tamale you know
 The what
 L Los cuajarones L
 L De qu a L
 L De de grasa
 E ste L

 L S
 L Eso quiere decir que se sale verdad del tamal L
 Doesn't matter how much you put on the masa
 or in the meat
 it goes out
 In steam

 L voy a L


 L Con qu L
 Eh
 L Con el batidor de los L cake s
 remember we did it last year with this
 Oh

 See

 L Mira
 Mira
 Mira L
 Does it look good
 Are you gonna mix the
 that tablespoon of masa
 Yeah
 With water
 Yeah I already did
 See
 You're gonna pour it in the meat

 Yeah
 What for
 So it won't be so

 So it'll hold it together
 Unhunh

 How do you get em so that they unroll
 Like that

 Barbara I mean
 Sharon doesn't know ma how to make tamales
 Nope
 God
 that makes the sauce
 Look at it

 With the masa
 L S L
 You know what your
 Unhunh
 Galvan used to do
 She roll some masa
 Yeah
 Like a little bolt
 And put it on the beans
 And the beef
 the beans were already to eat
 There's no way to spread this thing
 So I'm just chopping it up
 and it comes out pretty good
 L La boli ta L

 It's very nice
 Your grandpa always helped me
 Put the meat on it
 he never
 He never tried to
 to put the masa
 And that's the one that takes a lot of time
 Oops
 WH WH
 So

 Okay folks
 We got on the elevator right here
 came down and stood on the balcony overlooking the power plant
 down that stairway
 then right at that yellow line
 And you're now standing over the second largest water pipe in the world
 and it's called a penstock
 More about that a little bit later
 The Colorado River
 In order to build a dam here
 was to get rid of that river
 So they came up here above where the dam was to be built
 and drilled and blasted out
 Two on either side
 into the canyon wall
 out in the river down below
 Each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at fifty six feet in diameter
 and then lined with three feet of concrete
 You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels
 They then came up here
 to force this river into these diversion tunnels
 Came back down here
 about sixty five feet high
 to keep this water from backing into the work area
 They now had from here
 to here where they could build a dam
 They pumped the water out of this area
 and excavated down another hundred and thirty five feet to bedrock
 Okay folks
 looks like a series of boxes or blocks
 and those are wooden concrete forms
 Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high
 but they did vary in area somewhat
 because they did not build the dam right straight across the river
 from canyon wall to canyon wall
 they built it in the form of an arc
 And it's called an arch gravity design dam
 Where the force of the water
 and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wall
 It's a very strong design
 They did build two concrete mixing plants here
 they did pour concrete for twenty four hours a day
 three hundred and sixty five days a year
 For two years
 less six days
 Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eight cubic yard bucketloads
 Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms
 the smallest of which is twenty two by twenty five feet
 only filled that form up about three or four inches deep
 So there goes that story you may have heard
 that there are workers buried in the concrete here
 Couldn't possibly happen
 But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete
 was one inch steel water pipe
 They came down here in this lower cofferdam
 and they built an ice plant
 Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day
 They used that ice
 that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete
 As concrete hardens
 it produces heat
 The more you can control that heat
 the better job of curing you're going to get
 So they used the chilled water method
 forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete
 picking up some of that heat
 then carrying that heat out and away
 They felt if they did not use a method such as this
 that it would've taken approximately one hundred and fifty years
 for the concrete in the interior part of the dam to cool down
 So the system did work
 And then it hardened
 they left voids
 those voids were filled with grout
 Grout being a mixture of concrete and water
 When this is done
 or basically a solid block of concrete
 which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base
 fourty five feet across the top
 twelve hundred and fourty four feet from wingtip to wingtip
 seven hundred and twenty six point four feet high
 MRC Six point six million tons of concrete MRC
 That's enough concrete to build a two lane highway from New York City to San Francisco
 Or
 a four foot wide sidewalk from the North Pole to the South Pole
 Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit
 the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways
 As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon
 Here they are
 What they did
 closed these gates up here
 now this yellow part is forever under water
 Underneath that lake out there
 But they did incorporate
 the balance of those diversion tunnels
 using these outer two as spillway tunnels
 Now these spillways were built
 is twenty seven feet lower than the top of the dam
 This assures us that n any excess water coming down the Colorado River
 rather than overtopping the dam
 overtops these spillways on either side
 goes into the canyon wall
 out in the river down below
 Each one of these spillways is capable of handling two hundred thousand cubic feet per second of water
 That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls
 Falls three times higher than Niagara Falls does
 time that water reaches this area down in here
 it is flowing at between one hundred
 and one hundred and twenty miles an hour
 Okay we have protected the spillways
 now they had to get some water
 into the power plant
 What they did is they built four intake towers
 Two on either side of the river
 each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake
 are three hundred and ninety five feet high
 Each with two eleven by thirty two foot gates in them
 one gate near the bottom
 to let the water in
 The water then coming into the penstocks
 like the one we're standing over right now
 This penstock
 is three stories high
 Made in section twenty two feet long
 Each section weighing approximately a hundred and fifty tons
 Each of these twenty two foot sections is joined to the next section
 using pressure pins like this
 The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon
 approximately two hundred and thirty four pounds per square inch
 Okay we have the water this far
 each one of em going to a turbine
 The force of the water turns the turbine
 and generates power
 The water then coming on the tailrace
 and going on downstream to be used at least six more times
 to generate more power
 Good clean reusable non polluting source of energy
 The cost of the project
 A hundred and seventy five million dollars
 I say project
 the building of Boulder City about seven miles up the road
 the highway and the railway from Las Vegas out here to the dam site
 and in southern California they built the All American Canal
 which takes water to the people and the crops
 of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys
 This money was borrowed on a fifty year term at three percent interest
 and was paid off in full in nineteen eighty seven
 The people who worked here
 average twenty four hour work force was about thirty five hundred men
 The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete
 fourty three hundred men
 The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour
 Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator
 at a dollar and a quarter an hour
 Out of each man's paycheck
 a dollar and sixty cents
 Because the contractor was feeding
 and housing the men in Boulder City
 and taking them back and forth out here to the job site
 They did have ninety six industrial deaths
 The biggest single category of death was classified as falling material
 Basically falling rock
 But they did have some killed by explosion
 some by drowning
 and other types of accidents you might expect to have
 On a job of this magnitude
 They did complete the project
 Started in early nineteen thirty one
 completed in late nineteen thirty five
 Just twelve days short of five years
 Do I have any questions
 What's this overhead pipe here
 The overhead pipe
 That's the fresh air pipe
 In the summertime
 the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees
 So they bring that fresh air in
 and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam
 the water in that sump is a constant fifty three degrees
 It cools that air down to between sixty eight and seventy two degrees
 then they force it back throughout the dam
 So it's air conditioning without refrigeration
 Any other questions
 Yes
 Uh
 during the earthquake this morning
 that measure any kind of movement
 of str uctur es
 Right
 Yes
 W v we have several things
 First place we have three seismographs throughout the dam
 We recorded those
 But we do have sensors
 any movement that concrete makes
 is measured and recorded
 And they had very little of it this morning
 Any other questions
 How far are you sending electricity
 Okay
 Fifty six percent of our power goes to southern California
 twenty five percent of it stays in Nevada
 nineteen percent of it goes to Arizona
 What the government did
 To allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam was completed
 California was growing very fast at that time
 But by the same token
 at that time
 was nothing but a watering stop on the railroad
 No hotels
 we asked Las Vegas to take five percent of the power we could produce here
 and they agreed to do that
 But that's all they get today
 Because that contract is good through the year two thousand and seventeen
 So all those lights
 comes from power from steam plants
 owned and operated by Nevada Power Company
 using fossil fuel
 They get very little of our hydroelectric power
 Okay folks

 Okay
 Quite amazing
 Y yes it's a fantastic job they did down here
 Right now there's about two hundred
 That includes the security people
 the people that run the computer room
 And that's a twenty four hour figure
 But that figure is becoming smaller every year
 because every year we are becoming more highly computerized

 F Okay folks
 Okay
 Anybody needs the elevator it's available
 Anybody that needs the elevator it's is available
 Come on
 Come on then
 Up the stairway if you can
 P Up the stairway
 That's
 Up the stairs P
 Okay
 VOX Hi VOX
 That was the turbine over here
 off to the side
 That's a computer design made of stainless steel
 it's designed in such a way
 there's one of em running at a hundred and eighty RPM
 it actually lifts that eight hundred tons up a quarter of an inch
 for your main thrust bearing is the very top of this uh structure right down here
 This is the rotor
 The rotor and the runner
 have come out of our A Seven generator
 So we had to pull those out to fix that water seal
 they'll be replaced within a couple of weeks now
 Oh I see
 That rotor in that part of the shaft weighs five hundred and eighty tons
 Hey
 How you doing
 How long have you been doing these tours
 About five years
 I've retired twice
 can't stand retirement so
 Oh
 Anybody have any questions
 Yeah
 Ben
 water comes down the center of the
 where your shaft is
 goes out the turbine
 No
 goes around the dam
 Yeah
 No
 It comes into what they c
 the area of the wicket gate
 and there
 And there's a pipe around that wicket gate
 and that pipe goes from a thirteen foot diameter
 Okay
 It picks up speed
 By the time it enters that ap
 goes out that aperture
 But that's what drives that big turbine
 It goes around the shaft
 The wicket gate
 All the water goes in through the wicket gate
 It's coming in underneath
 The wick
 Th well
 perpendicular to the shaft
 and yeah
 The shaft is like this
 And then it goes ar ound like this

 with the
 looked like a
 that's a r turbine runner
 kicked up on the side like that
 No
 it just lays it
 Oh you mean the one d on the floor down there
 Oh you're right XX
 And that's down inside the
 in the turbine
 That's way down
 Right
 Okay folks
 right on in
 step right in the elevator
 P Three
 nineteen
 twenty P
 alright
 P Okay P
 Okay I saved room for you
 All right
 thanks a lot man
 Folks this does conclude your tour of the dam
 hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoying have you
 Have any questions on the way up
 ask Norm
 Bye bye folks
 Okay
 What's the story with this tile
 Wasn't this created by somebody
 Folks
 the dam was built as a tourist attraction
 this terrazzo flooring you see
 ground down and polished
 this terrazzo flooring was put in here by one Italian family
 Okay there's two and three quarter acres of this t terrazzo flooring in the floor
 but the designs you see
 is what that Italian family saw
 and interpretated from southwest Indian blankets and pottery
 Any other questions
 Are there just two elevators down
 that'll take you to XX
 Two elevators down
 Well there are
 there are two miles of tunnels going this way across the dam
 They have a pipe gallery
 they have a drainage gallery
 they have a
 a cable gallery
 and they have an instrumentation gallery
 And all those things are
 They measure constantly the condition of the dam with that instrumentation gallery
 Y'all open seven days a week
 Yeah
 Is it unusual to
 to do the generator room floor
 There's just
 It it's in fact
 and they wanted to make it a tourist attra
 Make it make it worth talking
 they wanted to make it very nice
 Usually you just have con crete deck s
 I would
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Any other questions folks
 Yes
 What are the chances of a leak
 Hm

 Well
 it leaks all the time
 You see concrete's porous
 And because concrete's porous
 But that's good
 Because if there're no moisture in concrete
 it dries out
 and spalls and chips
 and turns to powder
 Wouldn't make a very good dam
 So as long as that lake is back there
 it keeps that concrete in a stage of what we call being green
 Green concrete's very strong
 So we have a good strong dam
 Say Ben
 Yes
 don't think it's
 That's a five story parking garage
 and the new building is a new visitors center
 The five story parking garage will hold four hundred and fifty cars
 Okay
 the new f visitors center
 will have three revolving theaters in it
 it'll have a seating area for people going on tour
 the top deck of that building will be an observation platform
 we can look back at the dam in one direction
 Now
 they hope to be able to figure
 to handle between one point two and one point three million people a year
 Last year we had
 seven hundred and twenty nine thousand eight hundred and eighty nine people go through the dam
 but we had to turn people away
 Just not enough time in the day
 Hmm
 Will it have any slot machines in it
 No


 Pay for this place
 When's comple tion on that parking garage
 They figure between fifteen and seventeen months
 Yeah
 Okay folks
 Right on in
 VOX Everyone please fa ce the front of the car VOX
 Seventeen more months
 VOX Everyone face the front of the car please VOX
 Right to there
 Have they ever had to use the spillway
 Okay folks
 come back and see us again
 ask Norm
 Bye bye folks
 Have they ever had to use the spillway
 Folks
 Yes
 What happened that year
 is they had a very heavy snowpack in the Rocky Mountains
 and that was followed by rain and hot weather
 which created a flooding condition
 We had more water coming down the Colorado River system
 than they could put through the power plant
 Every reservoir in the Colorado River system was full to overflowing that year
 On July second
 water overtopped our spillways out here
 Six days later
 And that went on for sixty six days
 At the end of that time there was no damage to the dam
 or to the power plant
 but further on downstream where people had built in the floodplain
 they did have thirty million dollars worth of damage
 but no loss of life
 But that flood's what left that white line around the lake out there
 That white line indicates it was going over the spillways
 four and a half feet above floodstage
 It gives a false impression
 Or level the lake of the low
 Actually we're eight feet above normal
 Wow
 Yeah we had a very good snowpack last year

 Um
 first of all
 can tell me
 we talked a little bit about it
 talk about the history of the penguins
 Thanks
 No
 We have
 on exhibit now
 Wow

 That you have

 Um

 Last year
 I s want to say around Christmas time
 we went down
 as well as other researchers and scientists
 Mm
 Okay
 I want to go into a little bit about
 the history of the Gentus here

 for you
 For Don and Lori
 where
 Where did our original Gentu penguins come from
 Uh
 Wasn't it
 Where did the
 But
 specifi cally
 From the
 was it Edinburgh Zoo
 Great
 Yeah
 Right
 Okay
 Are those the ones that don't like people
 The hands off ones
 P H ands off one s P
 That came from
 Where's Ten from
 There
 Or is that
 Oh okay
 Well is
 Rockhoppers
 The
 No
 Magella nics
 Okay
 Ra
 So
 which
 I take it you work mammals as well
 Yeah
 so feel free to add in
 when
 cause I've only worked like a weekend
 but both days were spent with the penguins
 Feeding the baby penguins and then
 Ten and
 all of them
 Great
 So
 feel free
 after I've go through this information
 you know

 usually the best way that we can get
 volunteers
 in mammals
 so
 we got the penguins
 from this zoo in Scotland
 and

 you know
 and they go into a quarantine period
 I do believe it was thirty days
 Don't don't
 it's in my literature right there
 Uh
 there's a disease called n Newcastle's Disease
 is is very contagious apparently
 and so there's always the potential
 when you bring a bird over
 contamidate
 Mm
 Business
 Okay
 and so that is
 th background information
 Um
 with our other penguins
 we brought them over
 from Scotland
 in a quarantine period that they had
 that a vi
 had come to fruition
 and we had lost
 you know a good portion of penguins
 S o
 Wow
 now it's time to consider replacing these penguins
 how do we want to go about doing that
 Well
 really didn't want to go
 through
 Didn't work last time
 a potential for bringing over diseases
 the thought was okay let's get some eggs
 Um
 Sea World San Diego has Gentus
 apparently just not enough eggs to share
 If they had them they would gladly
 Same situation with the Edinburgh Zoo
 but
 they didn't feel that they had enough eggs
 we really didn't want to go the bird route
 and collecting some peng
 some penguin eggs ourselves
 So they went to
 and I don't know if this is pronounced correctly
 that's whe re a lot of seals are from as well
 That'll fit in with your class

 Yeah
 Hi
 Hey let me
 Oh okay
 Mine
 Right
 Why don't you have a seat

 P Oh I'm tired P
 So
 they went to Wiencke Island
 where a lot of seals are from
 and

 X
 Mhm
 Okay
 the process was
 the process was
 was they

 they went to the nest
 okay from our staff
 and
 frankly I I'm not quite sure who the entourage of other people were
 But
 they went to the nest
 and basically
 waited for the penguin to stand up
 and checked to see if there were two eggs there
 Hm
 Gentu penguins
 and this isn
 isn't true of all penguins
 when a penguin lays eggs
 one is smaller than the other
 Gentus lay two equally sized eggs
 Okay
 u m
 the reason I mentioned that was
 if one was smaller
 he would have went for the smaller egg
 Okay
 Why
 Because that would probably mean that
 Female
 they lay two dif ferent sized eggs
 Depending on the year
 and depending on the conditions of light


 environmental conditions are rough
 A penguin might lay two eggs
 P I don't P
 I don't really wanna use the word VOX decide VOX
 that's kind of anthropomorphic
 but
 somehow figure out
 Q at this point I'm gonna kick out an egg Q
 Ah
 h owever it does determine to do so
 will kick out an egg

 Otherwise
 it will brood the two eggs
 and hatch em out
 It's not uncommon that
 they'll kick out the smaller chick
 Right
 If at that point conditions don't seem to be sufficient to support raising two of em
 it's kind of like
 Mhm
 one of
 One of the chicks
 If it's a F great year


 WH WH
 They'll they'll
 they'll try to raise both


 I didn't catch that
 What wa

 WH Yeah WH

 Um
 so
 anyway
 Apparently what th what they
 Now at this point they wanted to see
 is there actually a fertile
 Is there a fertile chick
 apparently it was very very muddy
 it was abnormally warm
 and they couldn't
 They couldn't clean off the mud enough
 to be able to see inside
 To see if
 if it was viable
 they took an egg from nests
 And I think this this report says
 the eggs were back here in Chicago
 Wow
 That's pret ty nea t
 And then
 they took them to an L off site incubation area L
 in Addison
 I don't know where Addison is
 I don't either s
 West
 Yes
 So they were out in the west suburbs


 Mm
 A nd
 apparently now they're about
 Wow
 T s two weeks ago it was six ty days
 Okay
 Yeah
 Mm
 But when you see them
 you'll see that they're just about as big as number ten
 They're big
 N kay
 When I
 they were losing all of their hair
 And they looked
 the two oldest ones looked like Ten
 Right
 Right
 So basically
 we brought them here as chicks
 Okay
 as they lost their downy feathers
 they became eligible to go out onto exhibit
 And so what they did last time you guys were here
 there was maybe ten
 That were
 you know

 let them hang out for about a half an hour
 get acclimated to what was going on
 And do this
 Now they're out
 Now they're
 Almost all of em
 Two days ago there was twenty five out on exhibit
 So
 Um
 thing of it is
 is let's think a little bit about penguin natural history
 How
 how long do penguins spend on land
 Three months I think
 What's your guess
 Uh
 Okay
 Um
 four
 Six
 So
 So the sequence of events is
 they come on to shore
 springtime
 they hook up with their mate
 they build a nest
 they mate
 they lay their eggs
 they brood their eggs
 they molt
 and then they're out to sea
 So all of that has to happen
 within that six month period
 that's a pretty busy bird


 WH WH
 in order to be ready
 really need to be very well suited for that

 they need to have their adult feathers
 so
 Mm
 between the time that they actually hatch out
 and the time that they're ready to go out to sea
 How long does it take for them to hatch
 Well the incubation peri od
 Or
 to have experience
 it's it's one month to two months
 Okay
 you know basically
 between building a nest
 to to grow and get ready
 Okay
 So they're big
 Now the funny thing is
 according to Mark Ryan
 VOX well VOX

 I guess

 they walk into the exhibit
 and they start throwing penguins into the water
 And pushing them in
 and they're all over the place


 they try to get out
 Gentus usually dive in head first
 these guys are falling in

 so their behaviors if you will are
 Okay
 Um
 they're doing something different with these chicks than we've done with the other penguins
 Um
 yesterday I think is th is th is when they tried it for the first time
 and that crill
 Mhm
 you know from my joint
 so it's very difficult for a person to hold a crill

 and drop it into a penguin's mouth
 very good f s food source for them
 in addition to other things
 so
 they're throwing the crill into the water
 So they tried it yesterday
 So
 y a apparently they they'll keep doing this
 So
 Did
 When they were chicks
 cause what is it
 How does a mother feed a penguin chick
 Doesn't she bring food to it
 She regurgitates it
 But yeah
 and they regurgitate up the food
 and that's how they feed the chicks
 Actually other birds do that as well

 well
 but

 they started them off with strips of fish
 and they actually dipped it in a vitamin and um pureed crill batter

 and then gave it to the penguin chicks
 Hm
 for quite some time
 and now it's just interesting to see if they'll just go for the crill itself
 I didn't see it
 Yesterday was the first time
 Where the
 going from being hand fed
 Right
 Right
 So I don't know
 or if you wanna make the time to be down there at four thirty
 hopefully they'll do it again today
 I'll find out from Mark
 Yes
 Are there any particular trainers working with the penguins

 hm
 Are all the trainers allowed to work with the pen guins
 Yeah

 all of the trainers work with all of the animals
 So
 P Excuse me P
 So that the animals don't get attached to one person
 then
 a lead person for each animal

 Meg is lead otter
 Lisa Takaki was lead lag

 Mark is basically calling the shots
 for how the program's gonna be structured
 he's the penguin trivia guy
 So
 it's a neat story
 Mhm
 and
 for s for some of us
 underwater viewing gallery has not been your favorite place
 so
 this could bring new light to the underwater viewing gallery
 just give a new focus on the penguins
 you actually have some kinda neat things to interpret here
 Some other things that you might see
 the penguins segregate themselves
 Okay
 the Magellanics used to be off to the right
 and then
 could do whatever she wan ted

 I k
 I'm sorry
 I I k s
 what's number ten here

 the the penguins are numbered
 Oh okay

 on the arm
 Wing

 okay
 the the joint here
 what do you call this
 P Humerus P
 Hm
 At the humerus
 Hu
 We would have a ta g
 and they're color coded
 well how does it work
 When I was there
 Okay
 They're colors but
 Just seven
 Did they move em to number s
 What it is is that
 green
 That's number twel ve
 Okay
 S o
 they number them

 They can keep a record of what the animal eats
 Okay
 she
 because sh
 Because she's the lone feisty penguin

 that we had prior to the chicks coming in
 Okay

 actually the Gentus have kind of broken up into clumps
 and there's
 um
 let's see
 Let's
 G
 Let's interpret some of the behaviors we might see
 what is a penguin standing out with its arms like this
 Its

 Its wing s


 actually cooling o ff
 Yeah
 Yeah
 where the penguins don't have a a dense covering of feathers
 So if they wanna cool off
 Okay if I was to see a penguin doing this
 lifting one leg up
 Isn't it
 What else could it be
 Sleeping
 P No P
 Balance





 O kay
 So
 the wings
 and the f legs
 Mhm
 there's no dense feather coverage on the
 on the legs
 Okay
 I saw a penguin

 sneezing

 Allergic

 I've never heard a pen guin sneezing but





 How can you tell from it
 like shaking his head
 just like what a person sneezing
 you can tell
 When they jerk their head like that
 How was
 how does a penguin get its fresh water
 How does a penguin drink
 Oh
 I haven't studied penguins in a while
 do you know
 Hm mm
 From
 I thought a way w
 Drank from pools
 Just
 They'll drink salt wat er
 all also
 they actually metabolize the water
 that's stored in in the fat of the fish that they eat
 the fresh water from the salt water
 actually just have to separate out that salt
 So they have a special s
 So that's how they're do
 is they're getting rid of the sa lt
 In the beak
 And that is what separates the salt out
 And to get rid of that s a lt they
 they sneeze
 Yeah actually
 I remember doing the peng uin thing a year ago
 but I don't remember that adap ta tion
 Oh well
 Um
 we're gonna have to go up and do Q and A

 Just looking at the clock
 Who's do
 I don't
 Oh
 Um
 Mhm
 Yeah
 every day
 P Every day P
 when I see a penguin picking its butt
 What is it d oing

 Preening
 Kinda like
 Okay

 Yeah
 It's at the



 SM What's at the base of the tail SM
 I wouldn't've even thought of these thi ngs
 Well the anus is at the end of the tail
 oh
 didn't know they had meaning
 let's say near the anus
 What might be there


 It's
 Yeah
 that stores oil
 it'll get some oil on its beak
 it's rubbing that waterproofing
 So it can keep itself water proof
 all over its feathers
 Preening
 working an air layer
 at the base of the feathers
 because air is a better insulator than water
 water is like a vacuum cleaner
 it's a better insulator
 So when I see a penguin dive into the water
 what am I seeing
 The air is r
 Is
 Escaping from the feathers
 Right
 From the

 And will start preening
 working that air layer in
 getting some oil

 spreading it ou t
 How often do the
 S ome species'll molt twice
 Twice
 you know
 S o the last thing that a penguin does
 is
 yeah
 It does a clean sweep
 Mhm
 And then gets the new feathers on
 Okay
 So

 really the only training
 That they do with the penguins
 The the the the training that they do with the penguins
 Uh Rockhoppers' is here
 Gentus' is here
 unless you come to your feeding station
 Do they pretty much know that by now
 Have they pretty much adapted to that
 They were still in the room
 O kay
 they were pretty random about it
 because Mark would take
 you know a bucket over here
 With the
 HI yeah HI
 I mean
 the ones that were in there
 and they pretty much went
 where they were supposed to
 Yeah
 O kay
 I guess

 Not I'm not
 I'm not sure
 it's just kind of interesting
 other facilities
 you know
 the training that they do with these animals is pretty minimal
 they're pretty
 They can be aggressive
 they have big teeth
 People have historically done more training
 than they have with other animals
 with our penguins
 It's kinda neat stuff
 Cool
 Anything else
 For you guys
 the key to the penguin cart
 if you d
 The puf fin cart

 Are
 Yeah the
 Is on
 you don't have to bring the whole cart out
 I suggest that you check it out today

 there's just
 There's some neat things to interpret
 Check it out
 You've got underwater viewing
 At three
 you know for Lori to go do it

 I'll probably me ander coast al downstairs
 Cause there's a presentation close to four thirty
 Great
 Never mind
 I'll do it then
 When there's a presentation at three
 VOX Perfect VOX
 Mhm
 So that is penguin stuff
 can you guys go do Q and A
 or who

 I should've cancelled it then
 WH Guys why won't somebody do Q and A WH
 Do it together
 That's okay
 O kay
 And if it's
 Uh what time is Q and A
 two tw enty
 Now
 And
 Where's the
 where's the
 Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
 We'd like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park
 We have four geldings and one stallion that we'll present for you this afternoon
 and as we bring them out

 This is Bold Forbes
 Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion
 He is by the stallion Irish Castle
 He was bred by Lee Eaton
 This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventy four
 Mister Estaban Tizol
 liked Bold Forbes' pedigree
 that he decided he was going to buy him
 The cost ended up being fifteen thousand two hundred dollars
 and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico
 In Bold Forbes' very first start in Puerto Rico as a two year old
 he went off at odds of thirty five to one
 and he won that race by seventeen lengths
 He was entered into four more races
 he won them all
 and in doing so
 Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico
 so it didn't take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition
 So in the summer of nineteen seventy five
 In New York he won the Freemont Stakes
 Well all of Bold Forbes's races up to this point had been sprints
 The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race
 So as a three year old
 But his trainer had more confidence in him than that
 and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle
 Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby
 one length in front of the leader
 Honest Pleasure
 The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes
 But when the Belmont rolled around
 In October
 Again he ran a very game third
 So he was retired to stud from the track
 Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share
 and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm
 As a stallion
 Bold Apparel
 Air Forbes One
 Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars
 He was in eighteen races
 He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninety one
 He is twenty one years old
 Ladies and gentlemen
 Bold Forbes

 Does anyone have any questions
 Questions
 Okay
 over here in this paddock on the right
 this is Sergeant Pepper Feature
 he
 and only five stalls
 Um
 and
 and he had earnings of over nine hundred thousand dollars
 So
 on your way out today

 If anybody can see him
 watching the show

 Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions
 This is Imperator
 Perry
 He is out of the dam Empress Wing
 and she is by the great sire Wing Commander
 Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator
 Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois
 and he was purchased there as a two year old
 and then sent to his trainer
 Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared
 They both had the same birthday
 And as the years went past
 Mister Harris didn't get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did
 Being five gaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits
 the walk trot and canter
 plus two manmade gaits
 The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which they're performed
 Perry's greatest accomplishment was winning the five gaited world grand championship four times
 And he has also been reserve world champion five times
 He was shown eighty five times
 He has sixty eight blue ribbons
 Now the first time Perry was shown
 And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions
 But the second time he was shown
 the judges said he would have won if he'd been lying on his back
 with all four feet stuck up in the air
 Perry's most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail
 At the highlight of his career
 Perry's tail was fourteen feet long
 If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry
 you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail
 When Perry was retired
 and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from Perry's tail
 Well Perry had been retired here for about two years
 but had never had a formal retirement
 So in August of nineteen ninety one
 That night
 stepped into the ring
 and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteen eighties
 Perry is now twenty years old
 Ladies and gentlemen
 Imperator

 Does anyone have any questions
 while we're
 What's the average age that a horse lives to
 A good average is about twenty eight
 A a good way to compare horse ages to humans
 And
 I think the oldest liv
 was sixty two
 So don't multiply that that one by three
 That would be what
 a hundred and eighty six or something
 Are there any other questions
 No
 If anyone's interested in seeing what Perry looked like

 I don't know if if anybody noticed this
 there's a TV monitor right after you
 Where you buy your tickets when you come in
 and there's a
 An ongoing Hall of Champions presentation on this TV monitor up there
 and
 which was his most beautiful gait

 and that was

 Back there
 He wants to know how you say hi to a horse
 Um
 just say hi
 You can just say hi
 and they
 cause they know their names
 So if you wanted to say hi to Imperator
 just
 And he goes by Perry
 Our next horse is one of our two thoroughbred geldings here at the Hall of Champions
 Forego is by the Argentine stallion Forli
 and he is out of the champion race mare Lady Golconda
 He was bred and raised at Claiborne Farm in Paris Kentucky
 Due to Forego's large size
 because his owners thought they would give him more time to mature
 He started his racing career as a three year old
 Well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby
 on his way to sweeping the Triple Crown
 Well Forego wasn't as successful as Secretariat that day
 But he did run a fine race
 He was involved in a bumping incident
 He recovered from that
 but he and another horse
 bumped through the entire stretch
 After the steward's inquiry
 Forego had to settle for fourth
 because the steward said the bumping was all his fault
 The older Forego got
 He has also been voted one of the top ten racehorses of the century
 Being a handicap horse means that Forego ha
 over whatever distance he was asked to run
 in order to give the other horses more of a chance
 He was in thirty four handicap events
 The most weight Forego ever had to carry to victory
 And that was in the nineteen seventy six Marlboro Cup
 Well before the race it had rained
 and Forego was always a little wimpy about getting his feet wet
 So as the field turned for home
 Honest Pleasure had been the Kentucky Derby favorite that year
 He was three years younger than Forego
 and was carrying almost twenty pounds less in weight
 But determined to win
 Forego made up that last quarter mile
 and he beat Honest Pleasure at the wire
 The jockey that rode Forego
 said there wasn't a horse alive
 Forego was named horse of the year
 And he has also been champion sprinter
 An Eclipse Award is the highest honor a thoroughbred can receive
 And Forego holds eight Eclipse Awards
 Forego retired in nineteen seventy eight
 with earnings of over one point nine million dollars
 He was inducted into racing's hall of fame in nineteen seventy nine
 Forego is one of our senior citizens here at the Hall of Champions
 he is twenty four years old
 and stands a very impressive seventeen point one hands tall
 Ladies and gentlemen
 Forego

 Does anyone have any questions
 Questions

 Okay
 Oh
 Okay
 I don't have my glasses on
 I couldn't see you
 Um it varies

 like probably
 let's see
 oh about twelve hundred
 maybe twelve fifty
 some of the draft horses weigh over a ton
 in the draft horse barn
 some of the
 The the Shires are the tallest
 And
 Have you been to the draft barn yet
 Did you see Roy and Captain
 SM the two big Belgians SM
 They weigh
 they both weigh over two th
 I th
 I know Roy does
 Yes
 Isn't Secretariat
 didn't he die
 and wasn't he buried on this property somewhere
 he's buried at Claiborne Farm
 How did he die
 Pardon
 How did he die
 He was put down
 which is a disease of the h
 and and they put him down
 Our next horse to come out today
 and you'll see that he's a lot smaller than Forego
 This is John Henry
 John Henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings
 He is by the stallion Old Bob Bowers
 And he is out of the brood mare Once Double
 who outside of John Henry
 John was born on March ninth nineteen seventy five
 The farm kept John until nineteen seventy six
 Now this sale is not a very good time to sell a horse
 it's usually when people try to sell the horses they don't think are worth feeding through the winter
 So because of his small size
 John brought only eleven hundred dollars
 And from the time of this first sale
 John was sold
 and nobody could get along with him
 But in May of nineteen seventy eight
 decided it would be fun to own a racehorse
 Well Mister Rubin didn't know anything about horses
 and the only thing he knew about racing
 So he bought John Henry
 John then went to New York
 In his very first New York start
 His next race was on turf
 which John preferred to run on
 Well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than Mister Rubin did
 advised him to send John west
 where the turf racing was more lucrative
 So in late nineteen seventy nine
 John headed west
 Ronald McAnally
 In nineteen eighty
 In nineteen eighty one
 over one point seven million dollars
 In nineteen eighty two
 but they mounted up to one point two million dollars
 And when Mister McAnally wanted to bring John Henry back as a nine year old
 folks were pretty skeptical about his chances of being competitive at this age
 Well John did lose his first race that year
 but he went on to have his best year ever on the racetrack
 He won six graded stakes
 over two point three million dollars
 When John was retired in nineteen eighty four
 With earnings over six point five million dollars
 Since then Alisheba has beat his record
 John holds seven Eclipse Awards
 and was inducted into the racing hall of fame in nineteen ninety
 John was also named the thoroughbred horse of the decade
 John has been retired here for eight years now
 He is nineteen years old
 fifteen point one hands tall
 Ladies and gentlemen
 the great great John Henry

 Does anyone have any questions
 Yes
 The horses that retire here
 These horses are are not ridden anymore

 l like you said
 they each have their own paddock
 they
 and mostly they just hang out in their paddock
 they exercise themselves
 that's about all they do
 they get lots of treats
 s we think they're happy
 But
 they still run around

 just like young horses
 like Silver
 you know and do
 And it's real cute
 Forego'll run around
 Willie
 and his little goat will get out there and
 and run and
 Imperator usually likes to trot
 it's
 They're real cute
 There any other questions
 Yes
 What
 Uh
 the goat in with the horse
 Are they just good friends
 That's his little buddy
 They're just friends
 He
 And and he likes people
 or Sergeant Pepper so
 we don't want him to get lonely
 and that's his
 that's his little friend

 Originally they had got the goat for John Henry
 and they put the goat in the stall with him
 and
 so Willie adopted it

 And that original goat died about a year ago
 Our last horse to come out today
 A standardbred races at a trot or a pace
 Willie is a pacer
 Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana
 He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds
 so he did show some promise
 Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver
 But not long after he bought him
 so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio
 and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie
 Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before
 and his luck had been pretty bad
 The first horse he owned died
 and the second horse he owned made it to the races
 And after he sold her
 Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though
 and things didn't start off so well there either
 Willie was being raced at county fairs
 and was being beaten on a regular basis
 Well around this time Mister Farrington's wife Vivian was having a birthday
 and he was trying to decide what to get her
 So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian
 Well Vivian was a very religious person
 and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church
 So Vivian decided
 she would donate ten percent
 And that's when Willie's racing career took off
 Because of his success
 there was a book written about Willie
 Rambling Willie
 In order to promote his book
 Willie would hold autograph sessions
 One day when Willie was in New York
 And he was such a hit there

 Well Willie is without a doubt one of the toughest and most durable horses to ever race
 He raced from the age of two to thirteen
 He had an incredible three hundred and five starts
 He won a hundred and twenty eight times
 sixty nine times he finished second
 and seventy nine times he paced the mile
 which is a record Willie still holds today
 When he retired
 with earnings over two million dollars
 Willie is our other senior citizen here at the Hall of Champions
 he is twenty four years old
 Ladies and gentlemen
 Rambling Willie

 Now I'll just let everybody know
 And we'd like to thank everyone
 we hope you've had a good day
 Thank you very much

 Well let's kind of figure out a classic
 diet

 quota
 for you
 And
 so that we can write that down

 The way we do this
 is first of all
 of how many calories
 typically
 that you would need
 Hm m
 Alright
 I think we were gonna wait
 cause you were gonna change some things maybe
 first of all we make a good guesstimate
 Um
 m ost women
 unless you work out a lot
 You probably aren't burning much more than like eighteen hundred
 to maybe two thousand calories
 So
 what we can do

 I would say
 Just because

 um
 I think that would be a prudent place to
 to start out from
 I know I won't
 cause you to gain weight
 you probably won't lose any either
 But

 Okay
 So we're gonna take eighteen hundred ca lories
 Uh h
 How
 how many calories do you think I'm eating now


 but I'd actually need more amounts
 Although
 because
 I don't write down
 Well
 if you gave me real specific amounts
 th en I could
 okay
 I could count your cal ories
 I see
 And get a printout

 Hm
 O f your nutrient ratio
 Wow
 Mhm
 be

 like
 precise
 Um
 okay
 point four
 that's gonna be forty calories
 or excuse me
 coming from carbo hydrate
 And that's Doris's standard protoc ol really
 Okay times point four
 gives us seven hundred and twenty carbohydrate calorie s
 Yeah
 Then we divide that by four
 Calories per gram
 You've

 Which gives us a quota
 of a hundred and eighty grams of carbohydrate per day
 Actually I should've done that
 Okay
 That's low

 That's not that much

 a bit on the higher side
 And you always have some kinda lunch pretty much
 and you al ways have some kind of dinner
 Basical ly

 Now the mid morning snack
 would h have to
 to look at things
 But usually
 lunch and dinner are your main meals
 And we would give you about
 a thirty percent quota
 at both lunch and dinner
 which is
 about fifty four grams
 at each of those places
 Hm
 Would be sort of your ballpark quota
 And
 it's not outlandish
 Like here you were sixty four
 well
 Um
 Mm
 Here
 well you were about forty fifty nine
 So sixty four
 So it's a little bit higher
 And


 Yes
 Yeah
 I remember
 Like
 a long long time ago
 Let's see
 it was
 I guess forty
 Or some thing
 I think
 that's m more
 Right
 Let's see

 T_sounds pretty high
 That's
 Yeah
 A total of a hun dred and
 either on a higher calorie level
 or
 a higher percent
 Mhm
 Which is probably more realistic
 you eat more
 And we can change it up
 But we'll use this as a base
 to what you typically do
 and
 the thing is if you started doing this right now
 Right
 Cause you've already adjusted your insulin
 to another level
 But I think what you could learn from this
 at least
 if you sort of chose a standard place for a while
 it might be easier
 to do your insulin

 then you can start doing this flux with
 and you find
 well
 then you can jockey it from there
 Now at breakfast
 we often keep that down around twelve
 be cause
 Uh

 point one two times
 I thought you meant grams
 where do you find food
 that's that low
 Well

 some people actually end up having to do that
 That's only about twenty two grams
 Because of that dawn phenomenon
 Mm
 Then
 Unhunh
 Unhunh
 It's it's really difficult
 Let's see
 okay
 to distribute throughout the rest of the day
 And

 making a decision of how to do that
 really involves your insulins
 in the morning
 you've got a good amount
 for your snack there
 I would say maybe even ten percent here
 Um

 See
 Having to eat snacks
 Oh

 The on ly t rouble with that is

 at breakfast
 you
 MRC just won't have MRC your insulins there for you
 to eat the big carbo breakfast
 Unless
 you run high
 after breakfast
 when the insulins finally do get working
 But then you're run ning high
 Mhm
 you know
 you run high for an hour and a half
 and then all of a sudden it comes skyrocketing down
 When all the insulins get on board


 okay

 I wonder how
 How does Doris do that though
 I mean

 she just like
 has this really minimal dose of NPH
 I think
 You'd have to ask her
 That's what


 I don't know the trade secrets there
 Um
 but
 h you know I think
 probably
 um
 keeping the carbos a little on the lower side
 enable
 Of course then you'd need less insulin
 Mhm
 Cause you don't have to take these big amounts
 Um
 this actually
 Now
 mid afternoon
 but you don't really eat much of a snack
 Usually
 After lunch
 might have some Cheetos there I see
 Oh
 couldn't eat dinner
 Um


 where
 You know
 Um
 as a place to start
 why'd I do that
 And that's just hardly anything
 That's a f
 um
 then later on
 Cause you're kind of a nightowl
 and um

 let's see this'll go twenty two
 plus

 thirteen fifteen percent there
 so
 okay so
 essentially like breakfast

 So
 those would just be places to start from
 But I think

 what's even more im portant
 is
 well this is ridiculous
 I always have a seventy carbo dinner
 so what
 You know
 there's nothing wrong with that
 it just means
 you slightly adjust that insulin
 Same thing if you don't like snacks
 what are you gonna do to compens ate
 for the fact
 that
 there's there's a lotta insulin there maybe
 And
 how are you gonna get around that
 Um
 but that's the sole purpose of snacks
 lows from happening
 and to counteract

 the insulin time actions
 Um
 So
 M
 Oh
 Maybe we should compare

 Go ahead

 Oh
 say I didn't eat lunch
 Then what would happen
 Like
 then I could not take the insulin there

 And then
 Well
 you probably would need to eat a little something

 of your NPH peaking
 Mhm
 although
 you don't take a lot of NPH
 So
 In the morning yeah
 It may be debatable
 later in the af
 or
 b to get you into dinner
 Um

 You know
 Um
 y Doris could help you with that
 Did she give you a scale for a w no lunch
 lunch scale
 A w while ago
 but
 it changed after that
 See this was the original thing
 That I had
 She said
 but
 Okay
 this was
 hm
 This was a while ago
 three twenty four ninety four

 like
 she had these two things
 so if I was gonna eat
 like say I
 I decided ok
 Then
 I would take four
 units of NPH and then
 supplement it
 with the regular
 but if I knew
 like say in the morning
 That I wasn't gonna eat lunch
 Then
 she said take
 To me

 You know
 Yeah
 In in the afternoon
 Okay
 Yeah
 Cause
 it was before
 I had real ly
 Yeah
 Definitely

 you know
 on your insulins
 you know
 is the only one that can really clarify them
 you know
 it's tough

 to do the jockeying of of the food



 a a challenge there to
 Well
 this is where I got the idea that she d
 Well
 I don't know how she would have time
 anyway
 it's like
 you know five minutes here
 but
 then
 also
 just like
 I don't know
 Unhunh
 it's such a pain to have to stop and eat lunch
 You know
 And

 that's where I got that idea
 But
 Mhm
 Well

 Yeah
 And so four of N
 six of N
 and then zero regular there
 Yeah
 That's where just monitoring
 yeah
 Yeah
 R ight
 So it's
 Well anyway
 how can I
 How can I help you with all this

 I feel like
 we're still in a pickle
 in that
 it's just
 is so different





 and the carbos are varying around that

 but
 you know
 make some kind of a a goal
 to prevent these lows from happening
 Mhm
 a nd
 And
 that you could do
 to h clarify this a little bit more and

 Oh

 Well
 M maybe that's the only way
 Cause it seems like to me that
 P I don't know P
 I don't know
 It's
 if I have like some kind of set thing

 Yeah
 Kinda
 Cause otherwise
 I'll just do whatever I feel like doing
 you know


 Uh


 you you could give this a try
 is use
 what you're currently doing as sort of a backup guide
 Because
 obviously
 But
 well one day you have thirty eight at breakfast
 The next day you have none
 Um
 Yeah but that's like if it 's high
 Cause
 But
 you know
 and what you could do is sort of round these
 Like shoot for say twenty five
 just say every morning
 That's
 it it would work
 And then you just start learning from that
 you know that a thirty gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement
 on what you were doing
 dropping it down a little bit
 and yet
 s it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast
 or br ead
 Right
 so you could just lock into that
 And
 see see how that goes

 mid morning
 but
 try it
 a plastic baggie full of crackers
 That you take wi th you wherev er you go
 and just make it a standard habit
 M hm
 it could be a piece of fruit
 That is gonna be approximately in that ballpark
 And
 lunchtime
 I I would say maybe rounding it
 I might round it to sixty
 So
 so what if we increase your quota up to about forty five per cent
 That that's not the most important thing
 The main thing is that you're trying to hit those quotas consistently
 Um
 here

 if anything it's
 trying to maybe keep this down
 Mhm
 Aroun d fifteen to thirty
 But
 I agree
 that if you can make it a little more rock steady
 you should be able to smooth some of these things out a bit more
 to to go for
 But these are a little bit more scientifically derived
 Mhm
 what insulins are doing
 a a and when
 So
 Yeah
 Hm

 BR Oh BR
 amount of carbohydrate at dinner


 You know
 With your

 is keep this one
 because lunch
 well what are you gonna have really
 Maybe realistically
 this is only about
 forty
 Okay
 I would just adjust this
 fifty
 But dinner
 in that you have a regular sliding scale
 and
 realistically you should make this seventy
 Mhm
 but
 but call it seventy
 and then really try to stand by that
 And look at the insulin
 and what does happen over the course of the evening
 Um

 or what

 But but look at it and see
 Make it like seventy
 and then just stick to it
 Mhm
 O kay

 Okay

 That's something you could play with for a little while
 and see if if it helps
 in getting rid of some of the outliers
 That we're trying to fix up
 So
 um
 other questions

 What'd you do Sabrina

 It should be on the table
 On the desk
 N I don't know
 I don't know where my other glove is either
 He
 Cause he
 Hunh
 And
 yesterday
 the ke on the desk
 it was the spare
 My
 My original key was still there
 You know what
 I think I'm gonna take
 trade the spare key
 for the original key
 What's wrong with that key
 Too big and bulky
 You can find it though
 Yeah
 Should I put this pan
 Um
 Sabrina
 that card to
 Country Gen tleman
 XX
 No
 that we gave there
 You mean that one that I made
 No
 We had already given like three to them already
 Three cards
 I'd like to have it back
 Okay
 I'll try see if I can find it
 Wonder where I put it
 Hunh
 I'd like to just keep that card
 I left it at the carwash
 So they c
 If the carwash was that little party we saw
 I bet you they P threw a way P
 I wanted to keep that
 I should've just done it myself
 Hey you never know

 Ask Kendra
 She might have done something with it
 I'll ask
 I
 I
 You guys just
 Yeah
 I don't know why I bother sometimes

 Well when you said that though
 m my my new boss
 she came
 She told Mike yesterday
 she's I wanna be there at seven o'clock to go to community meeting
 And so Mike is there at seven fifteen
 I wonder where she is
 You know
 and he says I get up
 And so she comes in
 she says I apologize for for being late and everything
 we might have to scrape windows out here
 And so she went into the community afterwards
 VOX it hasn't been a good morning VOX she says
 I bought four five pairs of new pants
 She goes and I didn't bother to try em on before I left
 So she's all of em are not short enough
 these are the shorter one

 And then
 she brought bought a brand new attache case
 And yesterday was the first day she used it
 Put a bunch of stuff in it to read
 went home last night
 And she's
 I don't think it came with a kay and it's this
 K a key
 One that she bought just before she left
 She couldn't get it open

 don't worry
 they could probably
 Well that's what I told her
 P one of the P kids could probably have it out in thirty five seconds
 VOX I know VOX
 We won't

 So I had Bill come over
 Bill comes over with his Leatherman Toolman
 or
 Few minutes
 She's and I didn't bother
 She just likes it with the handle
 So she says
 My pants didn't fit
 and she says they're too long
 They
 You know
 and they were kinda long on her shoes
 And we were kidding her I says
 just buy real high heels
 Her attache case wouldn't
 Well
 this is not a good morning
 I says well
 Unhunh and that
 That ice stuff was thick too
 cause I took the blankets off my car this morn ing
 By the time I went out there again they were still f
 Mhm
 just that foggy stuff
 Why didn't you go work out this morning
 Ma my legs were kinda sore this mor ning
 I'm gonna go tomorrow
 Di
 you know if if I did pull something
 Y
 you know
 kind of a flu achy type thing
 Yeah cause Jenny had that flu today
 a lot of people have had it
 b you know the like s fall
 Paula went in and found out to the doctor
 just not feeling real well
 Gave her some antibiotics
 Yeah
 You know so I think it just might have been something around
 That's what I did all day today
 I had three or four different kids come up
 nasal
 So every time one of the doc
 Their docs came on
 I know
 it's just
 added their name
 It's just one of these long going flu things
 Bruce wanted to go hunting today


 he wasn't going today with Mike anyhow
 P And wasn't going hunting
 Today
 So P
 In fact
 then I didn't leave until f four o'clock
 And then him at the copier machine
 I said so much for getting out on time on Friday

 Oh yeah
 Well I thought
 and we didn't do anything all day long pretty much
 it was boring
 We had custom
 I tried
 It's really spicy Annette
 doesn't cut up his onions
 as s
 As smooth as I do
 And I think
 Yeah
 And when the chili powder says two to four teaspoons
 He used the four
 It 'll open up your sinuses
 Well I like
 Yeah
 And
 I think I'll only cook it for about another half hour
 Um
 because
 well we had customer appreciation day
 And we got corco corsages for em and stuff
 And
 they're like this is probably the last year you guys get to do this
 But
 but we had hot dog
 why waste money on a hot dog
 or
 on food when I could just eat a hot dog

 And I ate the other one
 Yeah
 and then we had cake
 that carrot cake from Costco
 and the chocolate with the cream f filling stuff
 mints and nuts
 and so I ate nut
 Those cashews
 I ate more today than I probably have all week long though

 P And then P
 but
 it was kinda nice
 Oh
 I was busy all day
 we opened the annex yesterday
 So yesterday was fine
 A gain
 It's just some
 Well then we moved some of em over
 And so we moved two of em back



 So um
 but then today I was the only nurse
 Mm
 I mean when you're used to doing that all the time you
 get up a system
 Yeah
 But
 it was kinda crazy
 it was going pretty good this morning

 and then I was gonna get a new admit
 And
 one of the docs came in and saw all of his kids
 and wrote orders on every kid
 So I had all these
 He'd change med orders
 and assignments and stuff so I had to take them all up
 so about two
 Ten after two I went over and got her
 then I had to do all the admit paper work and stuff

 onions
 He says that'd good

 I said what's what can you get a nice bouquet
 Twenty twenty five
 It's not my money
 Oh it comes out of the fund
 P I don't know where it P comes out of
 WH Man I WH
 I was supposed to leave money for Lettie's going away present
 In an envelope there
 And

 I was asking Anne what we were going to get her
 She decorates her home and her office
 And I thought this was really strange
 You know
 And and all y
 And I says what sh Lettie needs
 is plant
 but they die on her
 And in her office

 So I says
 what about a nice
 either silk plant
 or one of the silk trees
 You know
 I says that's very soothing
 when she's doing therapy and stuff
 And Anne says
 And I says you know

 silk warehouse for some of em
 And she's
 her real
 other decor ating she can do as she wants and pre fers
 where's
 Well
 no she's th
 Mm
 It'll be
 No
 Well so you'll still see her and stuff
 You know the the one doctor
 she's gonna take over her practice
 Oh
 And
 you know
 all these patients w
 all these pa tients were just kinda left on a
 and so she's been illing in quite a bit
 Yeah
 And that just kinda made her final decision
 that's what she wanted to do
 And she said but that's scary to do
 Oh yeah
 And she says
 So it was a perfect op portun ity
 Even though the circumstances are not the best
 XX XX pri vate practice
 Mhm

 When we sent Amy flowers
 cause she's staying with her mom now
 Cause she has to be watched
 Yeah
 And so we go
 Amy and Tony
 And then when you're not feeling well
 and
 cause Tony's no
 You know no
 Bugging and nosy and
 and I'm like I don't know who we'd wanna send flowers to
 cause they're both gonna drive each other crazy

 Well you're not the most pleasant person when you're sick
 HI I n
 Yeah
 that well
 I'm the nurse
 and I tell you
 VOX Annette you do not VOX
 Do not
 Just
 That's the way Jenny went home today sick

 Oh I said I don't wanna see you out

 One of the little kids came up to me and he said
 I got something to tell you Alice
 He said
 I bit both sides of my tongue
 And so he sticks his tongue out and shows me
 I said well don't HI do that HI anymore
 And he says and it hurts like heck
 and I said well don't do that anymore
 What a dipshit



 The other day
 he was tracking so well
 And I says well
 let me know
 and I'll s
 We'll
 I'll get the sa tr
 I'll save that tracking sheet
 He was so excited
 he's screaming
 He says guess what
 So he still stayed on level three


 And
 I know you did too
 so he did really good to
 Today also

 But he was the little kid
 Physically worked himself up into such a state
 Was he excited to see her
 Well this is the new stepmother
 And he's really excited
 but he's
 couldn't believe it
 Mm
 Wa

 Do you have a bunch of homework and stuff to do tomorrow
 Well that'll be good
 Yeah
 but I finally got a hold of Bishop Kelly
 they finally called me back
 About what
 Someone there
 I have to do twenty hour
 MRC Not my student teaching
 Totally different
 Well
 who sets that up
 Well you
 education department
 I'm su pposed to observe your school
 And so finally Doctor DeLiando called me back today
 I called Wednesday
 and then he called me back
 So
 So when do you start that
 I go in Tuesday
 To meet him
 And to get it set up then
 XX
 DeLiando
 I don't think that's how you
 I didn't think that's how you pronounced a good old Basque name but
 XXXX
 Well that's what I've b
 So then are you j
 Do you observe different teachers
 Or one teacher
 I can pick
 and then you can pick and

 You should sit in in Miss Brown's
 I wonder if she's still
 Oh you have to do Eng lish
 hm
 I don't know any of the English teachers now
 I
 I'll probably
 I mean and they want you to
 If you can help
 hm
 but it's also a lot of work for the teacher
 to find something that a s
 That you can do just being there
 an hour a week
 But sometimes you get bored
 I mean I
 Watching the same class for twenty hours
 it
 It helps you
 plus
 it also helps pass the time
 so I told Mickey
 Tuesday she's like
 Well I asked Cathlene I said
 right after we got off the phone
 Doctor DeLiando I said
 oh yeah
 XX
 that's a little bit
 Yeah
 And then I go
 you know
 we include her in things
 I told Mickey
 VOX I don't care VOX
 What does
 Does
 Chris teach teach there
 Uh
 Wouldn't it be funny if she taught English
 and you got to sit in
 Well I know
 Mom
 WH Rats WH
 Well I didn't know
 That's sad about that kid in the paper
 Who
 who's in the coma
 the star f baseball player at BK
 And he got that scholarship
 he was what a Gatorade player of the year
 two years ago
 and then he w
 He's in a coma
 Okay
 He got hit by that drunk driver
 And his younger brother
 And I g
 they're all gonna g
 sports are very important
 the older brother play baseball

 Yeah
 if you d don't wanna
 you just do whatever
 Well that's like
 there's a lot of pressure on this football team
 Osetty's son is
 Mhm
 cause he was a star player
 And they play Kuna
 No
 so I think we had to p

 We always played like Payette
 that we like beat every year
 our senior year
 Yeah
 Yeah

 But
 Well I never knew
 I didn't
 I could never even tell you half the players on the
 Yeah
 Mm I knew the ones that
 Mattered
 Yeah
 I went to a couple of the JV games
 P you know what I'm saying P
 Louis's game team lost
 Wednesday though
 So they're two and
 Mhm

 Cause when we came by the stadiu
 Uh the pavilion
 the football field
 they have
 They have game in
 The varsity has games Thursday and Friday
 O kay
 Yeah
 But there sure were
 There weren't a lot of people there
 Probably
 But that was
 seven o'clock
 just kind of
 Yeah
 on Wednesdays
 varsity probably starts at seven
 Maybe it's an eight o'clock
 seven thirty
 Yeah
 There weren't
 a whole lot of
 They were probably may maybe playing an out of town team
 And I know dad said
 yeah I don't know why they have the lights on yet
 because it still was really light out
 get it going

 And I thought maybe that was
 I thought may be it was the sophomores
 And so I was gonna go and watch his game after work
 go to work at XX and then
 then he had a game at seven
 VOX That was a weird thing VOX
 Mhm
 Yeah cause Diane came in today
 and she goes what's wrong with your legs
 And I said it was
 it was freak y
 Well that's how come I called in the morning

 Yeah
 how are your legs Annette and
 It's like

 I'm tired
 And then
 I remem
 to call early enough
 no
 kinda like
 VOX what kinda mother are you
 Well
 They know th
 P that we have different schedules and stuff P
 But yeah they're
 Like I said they're s
 That's what I think it was though
 Bug
 Yeah cause I didn't have an appetite
 you could
 not eat
 Now I've made up for it though
 Cause Jenny and I had to go over to the store and get the punch

 everything looked good at the store

 No

 That was like yesterday
 G I went and took it in for
 you know the
 maintenance thing
 And it was a free one
 That's what you told me
 And
 then dad wanted to go get that oil
 For the fans
 To oil
 put on the fans
 I said well you go do that
 Man
 everything looked good
 So a hundred dollars later

 I walked out of the grocery store
 Oh to get stuff for the soup


 he doesn't
 He doesn't call really
 I don't
 The only thing is like at at home
 I forgot to tell you
 Oh really

 I always remember at
 Once you get to it
 Yeah
 and then I just
 Yeah
 I was like VOX VOX
 Neighbors are gonna see this
 so I went out in the morning I'm like
 Oh God
 VOX VOX
 so I get out of my car
 stop in the driveway
 I'll just kill them
 But
 mm
 no
 he just
 He he
 he's become more attached
 and
 I think a lot of it is because a lot of his
 friends have now gotten married
 and he doesn't do as much with them
 And I think that's why
 I've always been very independent
 and a lot of it had to do with like me growing up the way I did
 with my my
 my mother dying
 Mhm
 and then moving to another aunt
 and
 I I've always had to go back and forth

 I've always done everything
 when my nephew started college
 she filled out all of his applications for where he was going and
 she did all of these things when he had to apply for a scholarship or whatever
 she filled out everything

 you read the form
 and you fill it out
 Wow
 you know
 and I was very much
 whatever I needed
 I I got my money from my father
 but
 I I didn't have anyone
 They're not extremely educated
 really on top of things
 and so when it came to things like that

 they wouldn't
 I mean they had no clue
 oh yeah go to school
 We want you to go to school

 Se
 Yeah
 I I see this with with black youths today
 because your generations in the past
 Mm
 you have a harder time deciding on what's a good school
 what's a good curriculum for you to take
 your your parents aren't able to talk to you about it
 W just as you were saying
 but black children have that even more so
 Because you har
 You're you're more likely not to be ha come from educated parents
 Whereas I came from an educated family
 it was just the fact
 they made us do everything on our own
 And
 black people also
 But I think they instilled s tried m tried to make me so strong
 that they forgot
 that I was a person
 and maybe it's the gayness coming out in me but
 I don't like it
 just went home to Indiana
 I went to hug my sister
 and I still feel that she finds a coldness in hugging
 She doesn't like to hug
 No
 Oh
 we've never been very
 and even like male female
 You don't do it
 See my my mother was like that more so
 And then my father was different
 Very emotional
 they were just
 See my family is more
 each member of the family is slightly different
 and different a amount of touch
 I always said
 that if I had children
 I would always
 I don't think you can overly hug

 with family and stuff like that
 I want to hug him
 I I I want my children
 if I if I ever had children
 to know
 that
 Right
 You know

 kept calling him Aunt Scott
 Because
 he he unwrapped
 oh that's just the way kids are today
 no that's the way you train your kids
 If you don't train your kids to be any better
 then they are
 But he'll tease Scott about
 and he'll laugh it off
 and he doesn't realize
 and it hurts Scott
 He doesn't know that he's gay
 Hm mm

 Has no idea
 He's probably he's gonna drop him off
 But

 it it's the way he is
 And so
 he
 and h and so his little boy is growing up the same way
 And he's like this big kid
 I wouldn't take it personal
 first of all
 Larry's twelve years old
 he's like six foot one
 I mean
 he's just probably a good two hundred fifty pounds I said
 At twelve
 At twelve years old
 And he's like two hundred and fifty pounds
 And I said Scott he's compensating
 for the fact
 I said so therefore
 he probably is a big bully at school
 And I said
 real bitter
 because nobody
 And I said his dad is just an a a jerk
 will call our house
 is just rude to Scott
 But yet he'll turn around and ask Scott to borrow five thousand dollars
 I mean like he just borrowed twenty five thousand dollars from Scott
 like two years ago
 So
 he gives Scott
 It takes him instead
 Like w Scott's got twenty five thousand dollars just to lay around
 Like that
 You know and
 that's the way his brother is
 You know very
 and he's just
 he's just mean to Scott
 just like
 oh just awful things about gay and
 why does n't Scott say something
 Because
 Scott hasn't dealt with his gayness himself
 who he is
 And that's why he doesn't say anything
 So you can't really blame the guy in the sense that
 And I keep tell ing Scott
 Because all of these things are hurting you
 VOX Yeah VOX
 I said i if that would have been my nephew
 VOX VOX

 I said my nephews d
 one of the little gi rls
 f
 tried pulling something on
 We went shopping
 and tried the little attitude in the in the mall
 And I grabbed her and I said
 I will knock you across that bench


 I just it's

 He's right
 They do talk bad
 that's not an excuse

 Hello
 Hello
 What's wrong
 P It's Jimmy P
 SM Why

 Why
 SM

 Okay
 alright
 Wel
 Yeah
 If you don't have enough gas and you're worried
 I wouldn't go anywhere either
 So why don't you call
 Bye

 He's afraid that he's gonna run out of gas getting over here
 I don't know
 just on that
 make it
 so he said he's like
 it's
 and so he's afraid
 that he'll run out on his way over here
 Oh
 Well he should just
 go to a gas station
 So he said he'll
 Well there's one down the street from his house
 Oh
 Instead

 But I don't know
 it's hard
 it's it is hard having
 to hide this like Scott's doing
 I couldn't hide it any longer than he has
 he's hiding it way too long
 Yeah

 I told my mother when I had like
 my boyfriend moved away
 She s
 Mm
 Cause I was really upset
 And then I s
 And then she's like
 cause he was sort of effeminate
 and I was really offended
 That's how she took it
 Yeah
 And I was really offended
 And I said VOX what do you mean he was weird VOX
 And she said he was sort of effeminate
 And I was like
 And I said well
 why
 And she's like
 no


 And I said
 yes I am
 I said
 how do you know me

 And she's just looking at me

 she ended up telling him I think eventually
 First thing I had to go to see a a psychiatrist
 Oh she made you go do that
 I went
 Oh Jim's mother told him that too
 See and then I went
 and the guy's like really nice
 tell me what's what's going on
 And I said well
 Nineteen
 And she said that's for the psychiatrist at nineteen
 enough about yourself at that age
 Right
 Well
 some to some extent
 So then I went to the psychiatrist and
 he's like well what's the problem
 my mother's upset because I'm gay

 And he's like


 And I didn't even think about how I said it
 And he interpreted w how I said it
 as how it was
 And you know what's really f unny
 and knowingly know that
 you know
 like when Mike told his friend Julia
 Mike was telling me that Julia said
 oh I don't like it
 You know
 I said to Mike
 And
 he said
 well
 I think she accepted it
 and he told her that he feels he was born with it
 no
 And I said to
 I hate when people say that
 if I felt that was my choice
 I don't think that would've been the first choice I would've picked

 And it's not to say that I'm ash amed of being gay
 what it is is that
 because of what society has done
 or has laid the rules for us
 I don't really think I would have chose to be gay
 I I wouldn't
 Why would I want to be gay
 Exactly
 And that's what I ex plained to my folks now and
 and they totally believe that it's
 like hereditary or genetic or whatever
 You know
 because
 They totally b
 Oh
 I believe it's it's
 I do believe it's something
 It's a gene
 I I don't think
 You you are
 gosh
 probably
 I can remember
 Five years old
 Yeah
 I re member looking at
 my uncle was sleeping
 on the couch
 in our family room
 and
 and his peepee fell out of his pants
 And I just stood there and stared at it
 an d I was

 cause I can remember feeling sexually interested

 So I knew then
 You you know what you feel inside
 You you c you can't
 And I don't care what anybody says
 I pick
 That I liked what I saw
 that I could actually just say oh
 wow
 You know
 And and if they say things like
 oh when I was maybe seven
 I slept with my cousin Tommy
 At the time
 no he was sixteen
 Shared a bed with him

 started fondling me
 And I was like seven years old
 And I I don't say that he did it to me
 the older uncle
 generally
 Hm
 not saying adults should've been more responsible
 but
 he did
 But I'm not gonna turn around and tell my aunt
 gee your son
 mol ested me as a child
 He's not gay
 Well
 we don't know


 Actually
 I think he is
 So
 Oh yeah


 But
 at the time no
 he ha
 Like when he turned twenty two
 he got married
 he has kids
 he just is very
 that was what happened to me
 And and I don't blame my cousin
 when I was growing up
 I remember watching one of our neighbors
 And I remember being mesmerized by his body
 I was never really that mesmerized by a female's body
 that's why I don't understand where they come up with this of
 it's your choice
 that that's what I felt
 Well
 I remember when I was li
 with my brothers
 Mhm
 Just like goofing around and stuff like that
 And then I think the l
 The experience when I was younger
 and my (vocal_noises_glottal_stop)older brothers had friends over
 I remember the f
 He he he come over with these friends
 in lust

 I must have been like nine or ten
 and I was just like idolizing these guys
 wow P
 I remember
 if I could have them in my bedroom
 See th yeah
 You know
 of oh if
 Li as if they were like a to y or something
 That was my older brother

 played football at Perdue
 Mhm
 and I used to go to games
 And
 these guys would like tickle me
 Cause I probably
 Mm
 I was probably about ten at the time
 and they just thought I was the nicest little boy
 I just had
 And
 And you know these things
 you know it's inside of you
 A nd
 you know
 what what do you do
 And I know my brother
 who lives in Dallas

 he
 He knew it
 He he knew
 he knew especially after Ron
 because when I left California
 I didn't come back here first
 Because my brother's like come and stay with me
 you can look for a job down here
 And so
 Ron flew to Dallas
 and went to my brother's house
 this is really odd for two friends
 to be this emotionally attached
 And I was like crying all the time
 and like when Ron came
 and blah blah blah
 Oh my God

 Having a
 Th a thing
 let me talk to him let me talk to him
 it is a little weird
 You know
 Yeah
 cause we went down there on a vacation of spring break once
 he really liked him a lot
 until that episode

 Really

 Why
 No h
 I think I'm afraid
 Oh
 I'm afraid that he's gonna come right out and ask me
 Oh
 about it
 and coming back to Wisconsin like a week later
 For holidays at all or anything
 Are you serious

 see I don't have any family in Wisconsin
 So when he comes home
 He did call me one time
 because he needed me to se sign a property agreement
 Mhm

 My
 So he called
 and left me a message
 and
 and
 send me the p

 So I haven't talked to my brother
 see I've been in Milwaukee for ten years
 about ten and a half years
 Wow
 He's a lot older than I am
 so he's nine years older than me
 So he's
 He's older
 Yeah
 He's in his fort ies
 Don't you think it's it's more that you were just nervous at the time
 Well now I'm gonna tell him
 I've t I keep telling myself every month
 call him
 and just tell him
 and I wanna
 He knows
 But
 I just couldn't
 just come right out and tell him then
 wel
 Ron came to the house
 they had to call the police
 Yes

 saying I'm gonna
 I'm gonna kill myself
 and
 th
 There was just so much to this VOX whole VOX
 Or isn't sure if he's gay
 Yes
 So
 Wait a second
 I thought this w guy was go was married
 Ron
 Ron
 he's married
 That's Darren
 No
 SM was also in a frat that I knew in college SM
 Oh those frat boys are too much
 I know
 He was the one that I told
 that if he'd had told me he loved me
 I would have never left Washington and moved with Ron
 I would have stuck with Darren
 I would have never
 Cause I never really
 like I said
 And I knew Ron was my friend
 And
 When I was in college
 if Scott wasn't here
 and Darren wasn't married to a woman
 I would be with Darren
 He was probably the best sexual partner
 I could ever imagine



 SM And we never had sex SM
 He's the only person I know who kissed me
 You never had sex
 Not
 you know
 Not the booty dance


 The booty dance

 Wow
 We had um
 You had oral sex
 But he was just
 and fine
 And I don't like men with like auburn hair
 But he had auburn hair
 six foot
 oh
 and he still is
 he is to die for
 I thought
 WH why WH
 He was the one that blamed me
 P P
 And we messed around
 But yet he was the one that grabbed me and threw me on the floor
 He confronted you and said that to you
 I called him
 And he said I don't want to talk to you
 you took advantage of me when I was drunk
 kissed me
 took my underwear off
 and
 he started it
 You know
 I knew what I was about
 I didn't get into it
 Right
 And
 he didn't speak to me for three months
 because he blamed me for that
 the third experience he blamed me for
 he's been blaming me for all of these experiences
 like
 Scott and I got serious like the year after
 I went out to Washington and stuff
 and that's when he stopped blaming me
 he calls me and tells me that he wants to be with me
 And
 he called
 You're kidding
 No
 But he's married to Lauren
 And I keep telling him
 before you have children
 Just get out of it
 don't carry any by baggage with you
 Always my biggest theory
 Mm
 And he loves her
 he loves her but he's not in love with her
 You know what I mean
 he he just

 but you're not in love with them
 Yeah
 And that's really har d
 Because
 you you find it very difficult to be
 to love someone and
 they misunderstand
 I don't know
 I think if there was ever anybody
 I truly
 But he k
 He
 everybody has that one person who breaks their heart
 Just incredibly because
 I wasn't really in love with his looks
 I've never met anybody who when you they touched you
 there was so much warmth
 just
 There was so much energy there
 That
 I mean
 So you've kept in con tact with him
 P Mm P
 yes
 Since nineteen
 Yeah
 That's ama zing
 What does he just call
 P when he's P
 He calls me
 I can't call him
 Oh
 Actually I can
 But I don't choose to call him
 He
 Like he used to travel
 they live
 they just moved
 He quit his job for her
 for her job
 So he used to travel all around the world
 Well whenever he come to Wisconsin for the dairy expo
 go to Chicago for some reason
 what he did was

 he took f farmers around from arou different parts of the world
 So his travel a lot of times was in Wisconsin
 because of the farms here
 They would see how things were done and
 he
 He like took them around the world
 You know doing this
 See
 I think Darren now
 he's with Lauren all the time
 And before
 He was gone
 I mean
 So now he's with Lauren every day
 And I think k
 For the last three or four months
 Oh
 He just started stop
 He just stopped trav eling
 And I think now it's just like
 I don't know if this is for me
 and he's starting to call me
 and I
 I know that you're with Scott
 And I'm just like
 and I'm not giving up my life for you
 He asked me once
 when I came back
 he asked me to move to Madison
 To be with him
 That was when he was on the peak of thinking maybe I am gay
 And I said
 well
 why don't I come out there first
 and he goes
 well yeah you can move out here and get your own apartment
 and lived by himself
 okay
 until I find
 It was just like
 and then he wanted the still straight life
 and this and that and other
 but he's moving closer I think to steps of being gay
 because when he was talking to me on the phone last week
 he was telling me how much he still loved me
 And he doesn't know what to do about this whole sit uation
 He doesn't know me
 we talked to each other maybe once a month
 Well that's quite a bit though
 like he went to Germany for six weeks
 Cause he was there
 training to t speak
 And he sent me
 a free k to to come and spend a week with him
 But at that time
 I would been with Scott like four years

 I don't think so
 for your little sex thing for that week
 I mean
 I st I love him
 I real ly do but
 I don't
 I also don't trust him
 I don't think any man
 who is as sexual as he w is
 and traveled as much as he did
 could stay
 celibate
 Right
 I mean when y I saw him once in Chicago
 I went to Chicago
 About four years ago
 Five years ago
 And he was in Chicago
 and he said
 you know
 and Sunday
 and I thought okay no big deal
 he'll have a room with two double beds
 No it was a king size bed
 So I thought
 So
 taking my sleeping bag

 and
 It was more than five years ago
 no
 So it was more than six years ago because
 it was when he asked Lauren to marry him
 So it's been about six and a half years so
 he asked Lauren to marry him
 and he says I really love Lauren
 I'm gonna marry her
 So I get in the bed
 I'm wearing my t shirt and my underwear
 and in the morning I wake up
 and here he is
 fondling me
 So I'm like
 You know
 so
 I'm like Darren
 he goes
 this isn't right
 you don't really want to be with me
 you just want the sexual part
 And I said that's all there is to it
 And he accepted it
 and I I don't know
 He always
 well how's Scott
 how is your sex life with Scott
 Are you happy with Scott
 you know
 And I'm like
 well Darren I haven't told you I missed you in years


 Is he like full of himself or what
 And he's another one too
 He knows he's good looking
 When we were were in college
 Mm
 And and what really gets me is th that
 I think
 the reason I always attracted
 is people always got the impression I was gay
 So
 and they wanted some experience
 and they they didn't want to approach another say man in your frat
 And they kinda thought you were gay
 and nobody really wanted to like say it
 they would approach me
 Mm
 So I always got all the good looking ones to always like
 come after me
 P Mm P
 you know I always think well
 I mean he was just like
 oh
 just perfect
 Darren
 a lot of people don't like auburn hair or reddish brown hair
 They don't ca care for it
 But Ron just is just a
 just a beautiful man
 I find that that's what happens in these fraternities
 Is you find a man who is curious about his sexuality
 And if they find someone who they question
 okay
 then they will tend to go after you a little bit faster
 So then you think
 like I was out at the Triangle
 how the hell did he end up with that VOX thing VOX
 And then I thought you know
 I betcha he's just out
 and he was just finding out
 and that's why he was out with him
 Oh
 it
 This was probab
 This was
 Yeah
 Well the w
 They were young
 The one guy in particular was young
 Mm
 I f
 I wouldn't think he would be more than twenty
 twenty one
 I couldn't
 So
 but

 no
 he was just very nice
 Ow
 Is he still a virgin
 Uh

 But
 was he a virgin when you knew him

 I meant
 has he ever had a girl where he didn't have to pay her
 Oh oh
 he got
 like
 I told you about the time he got like a blowjob at the lakefront
 No
 Um
 I was just
 me and Janine
 well let me back up here
 I started hanging out with Janine
 Janine and I got smashed
 and we like made out at the lakefront
 I don't need the de tails
 Oh cool
 how's she doing
 Okay

 we were like making out and stuff at Duncan lakefront
 did this like th two three times
 So after Victor's
 fighting over who he's gonna go home with
 he went home with this like
 one other girl
 me and Janine and all of us were walking down the hill
 You know
 where the pier is
 Except
 And it's like
 me and Janine were used to walking down that steep grassy part
 So we hurried up and went in the grassy part
 by the tennis courts
 It was real dark
 after we had gotten to that little plank
 So we like hurried up to this one spot we always went to
 You know and they
 started making out
 a hundred yards away from us
 You know
 but there's trees
 in front of a tree
 so you couldn't see them
 and we were sitting by like a tree
 so you couldn't see us
 So they were making out
 and we're sitting there talking and stuff and junk
 all of a sudden we hear

 and that was just the damndest noise

 so
 I'm like
 I know they're not doing what I think they're doing
 and we're looking around the corner
 And then all of a sudden
 Tom I don't know
 Or something
 and then I saw a head
 Or a movement lower than what I saw Tom
 he's getting head from this chick he didn't even know

 So
 I don't know if he
 it was getting late and she had to work in the morn ing

 But
 He's only paid for it
 Did he pay for it back home
 well
 it's kind of a good price

 nowadays here
 you know
 pay fifty bucks to go out to dinner and a movie
 and then you have to be real nice
 and then maybe just maybe
 if the wind's blowing in the right direction and
 WH just WH no one tripped over anything earlier in that day
 take fifty bucks
 go out with your friends and have some fun
 Or you could always go down to that one strip in Chicago
 What strip
 The one over
 by Crowbar
 No
 It's like by the bridge
 Okay what
 what's
 what ah
 There's all the
 the classic MRC type of prostitutes MRC

 and then
 I'll never forget the one time Rob and I went down to Chica
 I went to visit Rob in Chicago
 It was a Sunday afternoon

 You know
 Just for a Sunday drive
 all of a sudden we see the classic hooker

 Cause that's what it was
 And then she eventually like

 We're planning to go to New York in nineteen ninety nine
 Cool
 Two thousand we're gonna be in New York somewhere
 You're welcome to come along

 Well hopefully I won't be with Natalie by then so
 Which'd be
 That'll ruin everything

 Yeah

 Well my social life is naturally going downhill
 Shit
 I hate football

 Everyone's getting old

 That's what pisses me off
 the same thing is going on with

 and
 for about a month now she's had a boyfriend
 M hm

 like why would you wanna stay there
 Uh stay in the United States
 If I would

 You know in prison they'd never survive
 I know
 Not if you hurt women
 Then you become one


 Even though it wouldn't be ba d


 Well that doesn't
 there's this one
 like they tell like the different guys' point of view sometime
 And this one guy
 he
 there
 Well actually they tell like a couple different guys' n point of view
 and the guys get raped too
 Ah
 and then they'll like take these butt plugs
 and they'll shove it up their anus
 and
 they have to walk around with it
 Ah
 And then they have
 it's like
 sometimes they'll like stuff this other gag in their mouth
 And like tie it on their face

 And they have to walk
 And it's like
 this one guy was t say it was like
 they got sent to the village
 Which you don't wanna get sent to the village
 But they do
 And
 they go
 it was like this one guy
 And
 he winds up
 the master fi falls in love with him
 like the day before
 he's like a m human pony
 And they stick the
 the thing up his anus
 And it's got like a horse h

 And
 Pulling this cart around

 Okay
 But
 anyway
 we were talking
 cause it's like I was telling her
 we were talking about this these
 and then we got on the subject of anal sex
 and I told her I was like well
 I remember when
 my ex boyfriend tried to get me to try it
 But I said
 Mhm
 MRC Things are meant to come out
 in that hole

 Like twice
 She's like
 And
 that convinced
 VOX okay VOX
 Cause the one thing that's like
 when I
 what
 When
 and she said that like
 in the Muslim
 you know
 in Islam you're cons not considered Muslim anymore
 Oh
 But I remember like
 Lamar telling me once that
 Back home
 And she didn't wanna lose her virginity
 They were gonna have sex
 they always had anal sex
 Instead
 And
 I'm like

 VOX Ugh VOX
 Wow

 I l I listened to Def Comedy Jam
 This guy was telling jokes about Marlboros
 And how they're racist
 Did you ever hear this
 Did you ever notice a Marlboro
 That
 The filt
 The red thing
 Okay
 Okay
 now y
 Yeah
 It's a kay
 There's a kay
 There's a kay
 okay you with me
 So
 here's a kay
 here's a kay
 here's a kay
 There's no kay
 Three kays
 Oh
 Get it
 Never even thought about it
 VOX well there's room enough to put another kay here
 Somewhere
 but there's not
 Get it
 Yeah
 Three kays
 T

 But it's
 I just thought you'd find it interesting
 Anyways cool


 Okay
 What is this guy doing now


 Hey man
 Good to see you

 well
 I see you went ahead with your plans to do a little skiing there
 I did


 Yeah
 I mean I couldn't
 I couldn't begin to deal with the slightest pressure
 give it easy easy
 yeah don't
 Tha t still hur ts back here
 yeah
 Well
 you don't want to stretch
 you st
 Ch
 According to this other guy
 and the ligaments are the things that hold your joint together
 if they get
 you know
 you know
 you want to let em heal as strong as they can
 but you don't wanna stretch those ligaments very much when
 Just
 Just gradually bring it around
 Okay
 Just walking around
 Yeah
 Okay
 Uh
 it was really icy there
 it had a spike on it
 so I
 Yeah
 If you forget
 Bet you
 No

 Let me set you up there
 I
 I alread y have
 It's for a pro ject
 Cool
 Alright
 I thought you were doing something different
 I thought you were working with languages in
 Okla homa
 Or in California
 Yeah that's
 I did a year of it
 what I really l
 cause I really don't know quite what I want
 Well that's alright
 I mean
 I hope so

 I move to O klahoma

 Completely
 he
 He graduated from medical school this year and
 I mean he's in
 Soho in New York
 Reall y
 S tarting an art career


 so you see
 you know
 and just see whether he can do well enough with th at to
 Did he spec ialize at all
 he
 pulled him toward it
 and so he said well
 you know
 I guess he got a lot out of always doing art when he was young and
 I think
 see what happens
 you got
 You got plenty of
 There's
 fortunately
 this day and time I think it allows
 one to
 proceed like you're and
 I would've d
 You know
 although I r
 I didn't make the wrong decision for me
 But
 I'm sure I would have been a lot more
 Uh

 I guess
 in
 you really kinda just
 There wasn't too many things to do
 you too many opportunities
 chose between a few
 that was it
 Yeah



 a little simpler lifestyle in those days
 Tell me where it hurts
 Uh
 still a little bit back here
 Mm kay
 Doesn't feel quite normal back there
 un der
 It originall y hurt
 It would
 I think it did at fir
 He drew some blood out
 from here the first time
 Cause
 usually when they're torn bad
 Is that doing anything
 Nothing bad really
 Which one hurts more
 back
 or forward
 They're about the same
 Mm kay
 Well see
 Watch this one
 See I'm pushing back now
 Yeah
 and I'm pulling forward
 and it
 You get a little bit of pull
 coming forward it
 it moves out a little bit
 and
 tight
 It's got a good catch to it you know
 we're gonna pull
 pull it out
 Wow it doesn't have that same movement
 It's got a little more forward movement
 and it
 kinda
 has a
 so
 chances are
 you've hurt that
 ligament in the back too
 Uh
 The crossband
 Mhm yeah
 The
 Call
 I don't know what
 th they
 and one
 They cross because one's going forward and one's going backwards

 Yeah
 Your posterior's messed up a little bit

 Well
 Uh
 mm
 P get a little better maybe P
 It's not gonna get all the way right
 Mm
 It'll be a little bit of a problem
 I'm not sure you didn't maybe have some of that before

 let me see w how much this hurts here
 Mm
 None
 Mm mm

 My main physical activity

 Mm kay
 Lot of rolling
 lot of
 The knees do take something from that
 I believe that they
 A lot of work on em
 Any of those things gotta put some kinda stress on your leg
 I definitely want to get back to it though
 I had to lay off it for a while
 That hurts right over here
 It's not too bad though

 It's just very mild

 that
 That one could probably
 See look at the difference on here now
 what see
 See how much of a jiggle you got there
 you got just a little laxity there
 And this one's just a hair different
 I mean it
 But it hurts
 A bit
 Uh
 It hurt a lot at first
 and
 so
 you know
 You know
 and that's the posterior ex band
 if you want to put it like that

 Uh
 seems to be the problem
 but it's not
 I'm not sure you didn't have a little bit of that problem before
 It isn't
 All these years since the wreck
 the the leg's never felt
 it's never been t otally norm al but
 did your knee feel like it would
 Sorr that hurt s a bit
 Where did that get you
 Did your knee feel like it had some play in it
 I don't remember
 That being a
 Being a complaint while you were doing your martial arts stuff
 Still hurt a little bit too
 few years ag o and
 there were some times I came down on it
 and it did some
 But that was impact injury
 Let's see how rough that is
 Alright now straighten your knee out
 Yeah
 you've got a little
 Put your
 Yeah
 it's
 I've got a
 Alright
 hold your leg real strong there
 a pretty good muscle there
 Is that hurting anything
 Alright
 well I
 You know I
 probably
 it's mostly posterior cruciate

 the medial collateral ligament
 that ligament here is just minimally hurt

 I think some of that posterior cruciate was probably already r there
 because it really doesn't hurt that much when I pull on it
 See the
 This is the one that pulls on that
 Mhm
 When I push back
 I'm pushing on it
 That's
 And
 But see this one
 has been hurt
 That does hurt
 y it it hurts
 that's why I'm thinking that posterior is probably
 a lot of that's been there
 you may have hurt it a little bit more
 you know
 and y
 Both of em are a little
 both of em can probably heal up if you let em
 and
 No need for surgery to make it better
 And
 the
 the outcome will probably be
 pretty close to what you had before
 I
 but it's not
 something
 you'll just have to
 Try to have to see how it plays out
 And you can z
 You can overcome that a little bit
 by getting your muscle in better shape
 There are two things that stabilize your knee
 This is your knee brace
 In fact
 all the sports players they
 that they
 and they really have to compensate with their muscle power
 S o right
 Uh
 you know just
 just

 or what we call just those little short extensions
 just put a bolster under behind your leg right here
 extend the last twenty to thirty degrees with weight on your leg
 Mhm
 and keep working up on the weight
 Mhm
 you wanna b
 You
 you can just lock your knee real stiff
 And you don't have to move it when you do that
 Uh
 all kinda ways
 So just whatever the day will al permit
 and you got some time to do some isometrics
 But keeping this strong will compensate for your ligaments is the plan
 You know so
 you know
 Do you think I can go back to aikido and stuff
 Probably
 as long as it's not too too violent
 You know it's more form and
 stuff or it's
 It's about

 ideally it's about blending
 It's about blending with the attack
 Okay
 There's a lot of rolls
 Okay
 I guess if you got good at at doing it
 where you didn't
 getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something
 I think
 I think you'll you'll be able to see for yourself
 Because once you get your muscles strong
 it'll be pretty obvious to you whether you you have the type of control to do that
 What do you think the lesson should be from this

 I guess the less
 W one lesson is I'll probably shouldn't try skiing anymore

 I
 He

 You know
 Cause I'm lucky it wasn't worse
 When I
 It was a pretty bad fall
 the
 I don't know what grade but
 there was a turn in the wood

 I had been skiing for two and a half hours

 and I got carried away
 She showed me how when you're
 there was a turn and then
 I
 And the skis don't snap off of course
 it stuck
 You
 And I didn't know what I'd done
 I screamed and
 I don't know
 hobble on the ski pole
 Oh my God
 and then we had to call the
 s the ambulance to take us sixty kilometers to Oreille
 Geez

 Hunh
 I'm a little
 I
 and I was
 I've made it how many
 Ah that's unlikely
 I've
 No it's
 it looks pretty g ood
 Yeah
 the pain would be probably your first warning sign
 You could start feeling some change in the the status quo
 Changes
 I still feel
 Yeah
 It feels b pretty much like the other leg
 That's great
 Wonderful
 Great
 Well
 Love it
 Well I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself
 it's a cheap lesson



 I'd say so
 Yeah
 I
 I was out
 We were out
 and the kids were skiing
 God that would sure WH be fun
 And then s
 just barely my common sense won out
 but you know I've had two discs taken out of my back
 I don't need to go flumpity bump down the hill
 you just have to

 Mm
 It's tempting
 till I fell
 It's
 You know
 then I'd have to pay for it for the rest of my life
 No
 Good to see you
 Come see me
 And
 let me know what you get into
 I hope so
 I think it will
 See you
 Okay
 Just let us know
 if you need anything
 Okay
 Okay
 Yeah
 I'm in the cafeteria
 that was VOX just a little bit VOX too long man

 ha lf hour break
 You stretched a fifteen minute break into a half hour break

 And then he comes into the cafeteria
 And I thought he was coming in to chase everybody away
 But he's coming after me
 And he calls me

 And he goes
 And I go
 And on my production card
 Let's see
 The day before yesterday
 I did ice cream
 Right
 And you gotta pack those in cases
 And
 I don't know man
 I packed two pallets
 You know
 I don't know how many cases that is
 you know
 that shit was heavy man
 and like
 I put down on the card
 you know we

 I w

 Gutierrez was doing the same job
 N yeah
 he comes and says
 if you've
 packed this or not
 You know
 On your production card
 is that you did three thousand sheets
 but you did
 But you didn't pack it
 So I go
 stamped right on there
 VOX Oh
 And he goes
 I'm just going
 this is the pits man
 This is at the bottom of the
 This fucking mayate


 It's nothing new
 it's
 It's p ar for the course man
 Right

 Ts why I can't take that

 career doesn't work out for me
 I'm
 I'll be studying and
 but in a sense
 I need
 some type of steady income
 But
 but
 you s
 is it real tough
 on the lot
 Yeah
 There's def
 and they know how to talk to the people
 when somebody's coming in
 Oh
 and they're pretty helpful with me
 and
 you know it'll all come in time
 the more cards I get out

 I
 def inite
 I think s
 It's gonna be the fifteenth
 And I'll be working till nine o'clock
 they'll be pretty happy for me
 because
 Yeah
 But
 they didn't
 Yeah I think so
 They tol
 My dad told me he was gonna go to
 he only wrote one letter
 and and they were in
 No one's called em

 Other than that
 and he'll be in here no time
 Is he staying over at Miguel Juarez's
 Yeah
 Yeah
 And
 Pe
 Pedro Cruz
 Pedro Cru z
 I know Miguel
 Th one of his brother's sons or something
 Unhunh
 But
 and
 They weren't all heartbroken about
 you know
 Jeanie and that
 Well they have no ide a what's happening right now
 They must have been
 you know
 So when they come in
 Yeah
 But
 things will work out f for the best
 They're not sorry at all
 N o
 I
 With Jeanie
 She thought it might
 and
 She still considers you man
 Yeah
 and then
 and her her folks were at church
 n afterwards
 she wasn't at church last Sunday
 we went to the
 And
 I went over there
 our godson
 And
 you know
 everybody was real friendly and every thing
 Yeah
 I don't know if the parents are aware
 right
 that's not looked on too good hunh
 what they probably think is
 That
 m oving out was the best thing
 But sh
 until we both are ready for marriage
 and if she still loves me
 we wanna get married
 there's still the chance of us getting back together
 and getting married this time
 Yeah
 So I mean it
 She called me the other day and
 you know
 Yeah
 What
 what does
 your sisters say
 N they tell me to stay away from her
 Yeah
 But
 Yeah
 They're telling you that
 like
 you know
 you know

 Exactly
 she probably already does

 Yeah
 I'm not gonna just wait for her to call me
 It's not like I w
 I'm asking her
 let me move back in or
 I'm sor ry I
 You just
 Yeah
 So they
 they tell
 and
 And I sent her flowers last week
 Yeah

 and that
 you know I hope we could remain friends
 and that God brings us back together
 Yeah
 And she was real happy about this
 and
 And then
 Yeah
 I'd put her through and everything
 Yeah
 You had to get something out of your syste m
 And
 I might have to go to therapy or something


 Because there's no

 you know
 You should be like this

 I mean an
 you act out of
 it's okay
 and
 you know
 Yeah
 I shouldn't have thought like that at all
 Yeah
 This what a lady told me that
 She said it po
 Ma
 possibily was I was
 I wasn't happy with myself for some reason
 Yeah

 Wow
 So
 i it is a problem
 I I did have a nice old lady and
 Kind of mis s her and e verything

 and then you don't have any body to come home and share it with
 Yeah
 Y are y
 You're gonna be
 Nine to nine
 Well I mean
 That's a
 nine in the morning
 or
 two in the afternoon
 See
 So if I wanted to come in before two
 If I was on the evening shift
 I could come in and work from nine to nine
 So

 when you went last week
 Mhm
 Right on the spot
 Right on the spot
 if I felt I could sell
 if I had any experience
 You told him about all the cars
 C y sh you sh
 so sold cars all through my early years
 but it was private party
 f you've had you
 like thirty cars
 So I have some type of experience selling
 and
 th I have to work on
 Is
 filling out a contract
 and
 basically paperwork
 which is f very simple
 you know
 talking to somebody in
 to buying a car
 Yeah
 But yet
 That's right
 And you've gotta talk em into it
 and you gotta sell that car to em
 Otherwise
 Right
 If they believe you
 You need this c ar


 Maybe I could drop it five six hundred dollars
 W maybe it's it's three point nine financing
 that'll save you money in the long run
 if you finance fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars
 So

 it's
 it's like a game
 Yeah
 So homes
 Uh
 they
 they put you through training all these days
 fi ve days I watched
 that sold cars
 and made a hundred thous
 And he accomplished his goal
 and he retired
 certain amount of years selling and
 he just got into
 making
 audio cassettes
 In sales
 To motivati
 Motivation s tapes
 To sell

 vi deo tape s
 at least twenty cars a month
 every month for twelve months
 f seventy eighty thousand dollar bracket
 Twenty cars in a month
 That's almost a car a day
 Exactly
 Which isn't difficult

 for a damn twelve hours
 if you have the clients coming in
 That's the only thing
 Right

 And
 j save my money and
 Cond ominium or whatever the case may be

 I'm gonna be saving a lotta money working here
 I'll be able to

 To
 Yeah
 With the help of my parents of course
 because
 it happened
 to get you off
 Off my ass
 Off your
 and
 to realize that
 I had a good woman
 I shouldn't wanna have anybody else
 She spent twelve years of her life with me and
 she's always been positive thinker
 and
 Yeah
 understanding
 and
 S ure
 getting on your ca se
 didn't enjoy doing anything
 exac tly
 pretty much
 able to do anything that I wanted to do
 She was never negative or anything and
 So it happened for a reason
 Now I hope that
 you know
 she realizes that I'm
 and that she would give me that chance
 To go
 To go back
 Yeah
 But only time will tell
 And
 Yeah
 Even if she goes out with other men
 if if she does feel any attraction towards anybody else
 I'll never know
 But she'll know what her good thing was
 N yeah

 I know that feeling
 Yi gads
 But they paint
 We had ordered this
 Um

 Be
 Similar to that
 Was on their list of colors you could use
 We h

 wanted them to paint the inside trim of the new door they put on
 The
 the h
 Ca sement and the trim

 and the guy
 he had been at unemployment
 VOX oh my God
 Don't worry
 put two more coats of paint on
 the right color

 Mm
 Good work ers
 and every
 So what did they do
 the longer their job'll last
 but they
 it's done
 It's it's a
 yeah
 They don't do anything for the government
 But when you c
 I just did an ad for The Patriot
 Yesterday when I was in work
 Nine hundred thousand dollars
 for thirty four residences
 In East Boston and Revere
 So our contract was similar
 So it's it's an average of fifty thousand
 between f thirty and fifty thousand
 Like some people didn't want the rooms done
 We figured
 you know
 Might as well not take everything they're willing to give you
 Gotta
 Well
 No
 That doesn't go with doing over the room
 that room
 there's nobody
 oh the girls are in there
 So they didn't have to
 Unfortunately
 Hunh
 So what time
 I'm curious now
 Oh
 When
 Did they
 They put in
 they studded the outside walls
 You know
 Um
 and then they put insulation
 and then they put soundproof boards
 Then they put two layers
 of three quarter inch drywall
 And then they taped it all
 Oh
 And then they put a primer coat of paint on it
 So all we have to do is go in and paint it
 They put new woodwork along the bottom
 Danny and I got crap woodwork
 Ev
 All the room
 windows had to have woodwork for them to
 So
 M hm
 Dan ny and I put wallboard up
 and then we got this garbage trim
 That was on sale for three ninety five
 They replaced it with the stuff that was thirteen ninety five

 Had to put the
 Of put ting it up
 before they would replace
 before they would work on it
 just to get an
 because he decided he'd like a picture window in his kitchen


 Cause there were
 Oh they di d
 he threatened to take them to court
 so they re pla
 they told
 didn't they originally tell him
 he had to put a
 Yeah

 He died right after they put the window in

 Is that plugged in yet
 You might
 Oh
 Well well
 You know the
 The guy that used to live around the corner
 XXX XX
 That during bussing
 the Italian guy that l
 You can watch
 That was in tentional though Lucy

 Yeah
 I don't think he did

 That was


 No


 Yeah
 But the windows Al
 Are

 this wide now
 They're
 the living room windows
 It's two complete windows
 They have
 And
 There are two levels
 on the top
 With
 double glass
 So
 in every room I have to open at least two windows
 To get to the screen
 Mhm
 They're really nice
 P XXX XX XX P
 So how is that for washing your win dows
 You can pull
 They
 Oh
 Oh they XX XX
 But they stopped that

 Too bad they
 C oh
 Oh God
 Too bad you couldn't've got in on that
 They


 You know actually though
 We may
 I was just gonna ask you
 It
 S
 she had hers done last fall
 she could notice
 a big difference in the winter
 But in the summer
 Oh yeah

 But that
 the guy that came
 the first day from Mass Port said
 boy
 you're a couple of years too late for the air conditioning
 Ah

 Oh it had
 It has to
 Thirty five thousand
 More than that
 Like I said
 Just give me the money and

 We'll start somewhere else
 It is a really strange regulation though
 Um
 did all this work
 just so they could
 Come in and tear it down
 So that you can't s
 And get in the carpen ters' way
 But they
 Really
 For at least twenty years after the work is completed
 But since
 But for them it 's
 you know
 for the workers themsel ves it's like
 The room was b
 The room didn't even have anything up John
 No walls
 We put the walls up
 put the new win dows in
 They had to come in and tear stuff down
 And of course
 the stuff that we put up
 wasn't first quality
 w why would we spend the money
 so everything they touched
 Yes
 And they told you to f
 you had to do that
 They had to bring out whatev
 You know
 the
 It was like a tradeoff
 Ah
 Um
 well
 you know the r
 There's a room off my bedroom
 That used to be a porch
 That Dan ny and I put the walls in
 That Joe built
 And then we put a cei
 it was the r

 The room that Joe built



 they
 and put woodwork on
 They came in and they said
 while we were working on it

 At least
 for insula
 If you don't feel like putting it up
 Not to b other
 let them do it
 You know
 Sure
 And they re quire you have a f
 You had to have it fini
 but they were gonna put in the
 Um
 But they put all new windows in
 and we put up the junk woodwork
 and they put up
 That was a
 Hm
 It was great working in that room
 We



 How about
 Because they had varied so much
 you know it'd go from like
 It's just
 But y
 when you consider that Joe used old doors
 that he found in garbage buckets


 from other people's homes


 Well
 did he have
 Frank out
 Did he have

 in the
 He probably did


 Can you get them to put some of them toilet seats in
 that they put in the Navy


 I didn't see in Lucy's house yet but
 I don't have to cause
 Johny gave me the
 the guided tour
 I couldn't get rid of Johny one day for
 I was out on their porch XXXX
 He had sliders put on the din
 You know that archway between the living room and the dining room
 And the
 hall
 They're b eautiful
 Johny doesn't have any openings like that in his house
 Yeah
 Yeah but the doors they put in
 He had like
 two year old top of the line Andersen sliding glass windows in
 Going out to the porch
 And they tore them out
 Yeah
 five thousand dollar door or something
 Three panes of glass
 Fifteen pound brass handles on them
 Mhm
 Now they use all brass
 they put a
 Our front door has two locks now
 the one like we had
 And then it has the knob lock
 But it's
 And that's all brass
 French doors in the living room
 Those aren't even going anywhere
 room going into the dining roo m
 so it wouldn't XX
 When you go to work

 doesn't that
 Doesn't the noise come in from the room
 from the dining room
 I don't know
 I'm
 I'm not gonna complain
 You know
 How can I complain
 Now all we need to do is
 something to make that roof stop leak ing
 H
 You have oil heat in your house
 Forced hot air
 Yeah
 So the air conditioning would have been a bree ze for them to put in

 And
 hook that right into the central air
 I
 Yesterday
 at the coffee shop
 And he said
 he's been f fielding calls all week from neighbors
 Who would love to have their house done
 but it's a matter of
 point two decibels
 The people
 dir directly
 across the street diagonally from me
 Couldn't get it done because
 their
 decibel level
 Gee
 Wow
 So it
 And he said there's nothing you can do
 It's FDA
 that
 one is danger
 is hazardous
 Yeah
 And the other isn't
 and if they start changing their regulations
 People who
 had theirs done three years ago
 and their neighbors across the street couldn't
 the neighbors across the street are gonna be coming after them
 You know
 So
 Why are they attacking him
 because you told him that
 No no no

 all of my immediate neighbors had it done
 Oh
 I couldn't understand
 Yeah
 Why they would refuse
 God
 That's ridicu lous
 They don't want people investigating their house Annette

 Yeah
 That or they like the house the way it is
 Yeah
 No
 because now they're kicking themselves
 There are three or four of them that said
 I suppose at the
 at the time you
 Mm
 But
 they had big meetings
 And
 Well y I c
 Maybe

 Yeah

 her heat heating bill
 Was lower than half

 They insulate all a round the windows with
 Pat said they b
 First they blew in insulation
 something else
 on on top of that
 Well it's gonna make your house much ea sier to heat
 What's Sab
 Yeah
 Frank probably had his house in fairly good shape though
 Well their s on is a carpenter
 So
 Or at least collect ing
 At least collec ting I

 Oh yeah
 And it was like a thirteen to ten thriller
 Canadian fans just
 went away in droves
 So like five thousand people showed up for it

 Be like watching soccer
 Midgets that can't play in the NFL up there

 and it's supposed to only go in one millimeter in a healthy tooth
 I had the whole mouth done that
 it went in s ix millimeters
 gum is breaking down
 But his analysis is
 And the tooth under the crown

 until I saw Patty's earrings
 cause I saw that hers were pretty
 Hm
 and a little boy and a deer
 Mm
 And
 until Brenda pointed it out
 S the little boy had brought the deer to Santa Claus
 Santa Claus was bandaging its foot
 Its foot was up there

 for a whole five pound bag of sugar
 a fit in the thing
 Mm
 And
 Stores bug me
 makes me mad
 and I turn around and walk out after a little while
 Mhm
 And
 I knew she wanted that
 I saw something
 that I thought she needed

 that she hadn't said she'd needed
 that way it'd be
 a little bit of a surprise
 remembered me saying
 Yeah
 Cause she just had loaves of bread up on the counter
 And
 And there were like two or three loaves of bread
 And
 And
 I kept watching the ads
 well I'll see some place that has the kind I'm looking for for em

 real dark brown
 As op posed to my kinda medium brown
 And so
 but all the ones in the paper were showing
 the lighter maple type wood

 He invented it

 Was that just recently on the news
 Because that se

 She was in so much pain
 Yeah
 A nd
 That sounds like those screws things that
 Yeah

 Hm
 So um
 Terrifying
 I don't

 Well
 I very brie fly thought of having my jaw fixed for
 Uh
 See my bottom jaw doesn't come up quite far enough
 Yeah
 And um
 I tell you
 that's
 I'm gonna have to be in a really bi
 I'm not volunteering for anything
 Uh
 Surgery wise
 Oh
 Darlee it doesn't chang
 You're li
 Uh
 Don't ever take a picture of me from the side
 I saw me on television
 Talking



 San Antonio Housing Authority putting
 the houses in your neighborhood
 You know
 I said hey
 They put all three on my street
 And
 They put what on your street
 Oh yeah
 this is
 Usually it's
 p
 PAR
 Something with a number in it

 Yeah that's how they

 I don't really know
 And
 They check on the stuff and all
 At least San Antonio Housing Authority does
 Well
 One of the guys is
 family is
 and it's
 husband and wife and two kids
 He works for the city
 But
 like my house
 damn good thing I bought it when I did
 My friend up the street
 she pays almost five hundred dollars a month house payments
 this guy gets his for ninety dollars a month
 Yeah
 I mean

 give the people who aren't making the money a break
 But one fifth

 How much could that person be making less than say Danny right now
 Um
 Yeah

 But
 So
 they just got all kinda planters
 They don't
 They haven't gotten to the point of
 putting their old water heater out there or anything like that
 There's one house
 we
 Somebody got a list of the houses on this one
 um
 And
 me

 And
 about half of em were as nice as mine or nicer
 You know m
 Then some of em had better landscaping
 But
 you know like I keep my lawn mowed
 About half of em were as good
 or better than mine
 Which
 That's fine
 Yeah
 They they
 The other half
 they
 long weeds and stuff was the least of the the problem
 This one house had
 it looked like an abandoned junkyard
 It had so many old appliances
 I don't know what the
 what the thing was
 But you find people do that
 that
 all all
 I hate to say it
 That do that
 There's no reason for
 I cannot
 I don't underst
 right
 But I I
 Yeah
 But if
 If people had to come to my house
 and pass one of these houses that look like that
 I'd call the health department
 Cause I think it is
 Yeah
 Yeah
 all those little spaces they can get into and stuff
 Yeah
 I gue I gue
 Yeah
 That's true
 evidently
 about a year after that
 And
 it was still the same way
 Worse
 Wo rse
 Yea h
 it gets

 I don't know

 I wish I could think of the name of that other program
 See this one guy at the store had a house
 so
 he got with one of these
 um
 support things and

 like HUD
 and they guaranteed him
 a residence
 Section eight
 Yeah
 P Yeah P
 it worked out good for him
 You know
 he took it off that and
 he got his finances back in order
 So it worked out good for him on that
 all the people that had rented his house
 he said Section eight
 That
 But on this other program
 it didn't look like they did
 Yeah
 So
 anyway
 But
 So what did you get
 And now how did we get on that
 Hunh

 I can't understand you
 I I don't know
 oh I
 How we jumped to that
 Uh
 But
 oh

 a little Christmas statue from Brenda and Danny
 it's
 I don't know
 what it's made out of
 and it's real cute
 little boy
 And un til Brenda pointed it out to me
 It looks like the little boy brought the deer
 to Santa Claus
 for Santa Claus to fix its
 Had the deer with its leg up
 and Sa nta Claus was bandaging it
 Oh


 So
 That's cute
 well and
 Did uh Andy mention anything about the cards
 that we got for Christmas
 Unh un h
 Oh
 why don't I let him tell you
 we really got struck by it
 because it's
 That your mom really liked

 What was it
 What s s
 Wait a se
 Helen Steiner Rice
 Helen Keller Rice
 Or something like that
 he was all excited
 kinda made sure that we
 sent em all to you guys
 Because we were thinking that maybe one of you might remember that
 Yeah
 Stei ner Rice
 I had n
 I had never heard of her
 but
 they were nice verses
 That
 from
 one of my friends
 that was from
 MD Anderson
 you know

 MD Anderson cancer thing
 Oh yeah
 So I thought that was nice too
 P Yeah
 Well listen
 Oka y
 Bye bye
 Who's there
 Darlene
 HI Yeah HI
 So you had a good Ch
 So she said you wanted to tell me about that Christmas card
 Hunh
 She said you wanted to tell me about that Helen Steiner R
 Well I was gonna tell you about it

 Well it was Helen Steiner Rice
 I know
 That's


 Yeah

 Okay
 the next case will be
 Is this contested
 Oh okay
 Are you
 Are you the plaintiff
 No
 Oh
 on the countersuit

 P Let me have this pen for a minute
 Oh

 Yeah
 Sign here
 Yes
 this is a case that a v
 not present
 against Rose Black
 um
 asking for a security deposit
 and since he's not here

 and then there was a cross complaint
 defendant's claim

 by Rose Black
 for five hundred and thirty three dollars
 balance of rent due
 And Miss Black
 Mh m
 And was there a written agreement
 or a lease
 Was it a l
 month to month
 or a
 A one year lea se
 Okay

 Uh this was the
 um
 So there was original security deposit of eighteen hundred and seventy five dolla rs
 And then you did some repairs on
 Okay
 How come they were
 They had removed the screen s
 Alright
 And then um
 they owed some rent
 Uh
 the
 The lease was terminated
 They broke s one of the conditions of the lease
 O kay
 So I had to give them a three day notice to leave
 T
 three day notice to
 Well I know
 normally you would give em three day notice to perform

 O kay


 They were not able to be quiet
 U m what ha
 so then they
 So then they left within that three days
 No
 At the end of June
 They paid the rent for June
 Okay
 July first
 And there were two months left of the lease
 D
 And rent's
 thousand
 two hundred
 Now
 did you rerent the
 So it reduced

 Uh
 after they moved out
 because they m
 you got
 So you're giving a three day's credit
 It was forty two fifty
 Okay
 Five hundred and thirty three dollar
 And I don't
 Mhm
 Well that seems
 fundamentally fair
 And I will hand back your documents
 P And how do I get them to pay
 P
 P Thank you P
 P There's a small claims advisor that you can ask P
 Okay
 the next case will be
 versus Matthew Collins
 This
 Is this contested

 Who's Mitchell Roberts
 Okay
 Sit on this side here
 XXX
 P Sure P
 Who's the party being s served
 You are
 Thank you
 Nice pen
 Alright
 Okay
 Right here
 And you brought an action
 against Matthew Collins
 for
 roughly seven hundred dollars
 for labor installing a carpet
 T
 during last August to September
 okay
 and
 just tell me about how you arrived at this claim
 Uh I was called by Matthew here
 to do the job for him
 Okay
 you run a
 you run a a carpet business I presume
 Um
 I went and estimated the job for myself
 for what he wanted to pay for it
 and I let him know that I could not
 Do the job
 I wouldn't make any money
 So
 upon me telling him that
 he offered
 to pay my employees
 fill out
 and he paid him
 so that I in turn would make more money off the job
 I agreed to that
 after about
 Ca is that a normal procedure XX
 He wanted me to do the job
 so he offered to take some of the monitory burden off my back
 so that I could do it for the agreed amounts that we were gonna do it on
 So in other words
 your
 So then your costs would be reduced there as far as
 That's correc t
 Uh
 I went to receive my check
 of which
 we had agreed
 that he would deduct
 the amount of the hourly wage
 that he was
 or verbal
 Completely verbal
 Uh
 upon a reve
 receiving my check

 for about two and a half weeks of work
 approximately between fifty and seventy hours
 So I approached him with it
 and he handed me this yellow piece of paper here
 and noted that
 what the employees made
 and
 at twenty six percent less deduction on these two employees
 Which was the employer contribution
 So I noted to him that he was supposed to pay that
 he said
 n
 no
 you're gonna pay it
 So I said that's not as per our agreement
 And he's there to state
 he's
 he saw that
 and was witness to that
 I have a letter
 But
 that
 finally I contacted my attorney
 I'd like to present this letter to you here
 Okay
 have you shown that to Mister Collins
 He has
 he has received a copy of that letter

 Now Stu Roberts is an attorney
 Yes sir
 You're
 I'm his nephew
 And you're Nick Ro Roberts' nephew too then
 That's correct
 Okay
 So your uncle then wrote Builders a letter
 Yes sir
 Uh I do emphasize that I'm reading it
 tha t you've told Mister Roberts
 That's correct
 So really the dispute then boils down to this twenty six percent
 That's it sir
 Okay
 That's the reason why I had him fill out that portion of
 or he wanted to write those checks
 Was so I would save that money
 Okay
 Mister Collins I know you're
 biting at the bit there
 you wanna say something
 Okay thank you your honor
 Um
 pretty much
 um
 what Mitchell has stated is untrue
 Mitchell
 did do some work for me out at the college
 And this is a
 eight thousand yard job
 that we did this summer
 It required us to
 employ
 oh five or six crews
 Mitchell Roberts was one of them that we used
 Uh Mitchell expressed a desire to do the work out there
 he expressed
 he did not know how to handle the payroll
 Most of the contractors here in town
 don't know how to do prevailing wage statements
 The college is a state funded remodel
 and on state funded remodels
 to pay prevailing wages
 Uh prevailing wages
 that

 that indicate different levels of agility
 of the different men working
 And so
 a lot of the crews

 like Mitchell
 who have people that work under him
 around town
 in regular situations
 come to the people like me
 When we do the payroll for them
 we state to them up front
 that
 we will make the deductions
 and then the employer contribution
 which is approximately twenty six percent
 over and above the hourly wage
 is also deducted
 from the subcontractor's check
 Now this th twenty six percent
 that'd be be social security
 Um
 Sorta like
 Th at's anything above that
 Well you have
 XXX
 you have that
 I have a breakdown here
 Okay
 I mean
 do
 y you got a total of
 seven point six five percent employer contributions on the
 Um
 that explains it pretty well
 of course

 Oh and and the oh the
 the f
 and
 F UDA FICA
 Now that's
 um
 in any payroll deduction situation
 the employee contribution
 which is deducted from the employee's wages
 and then you have the employer's contribution
 Which the employer has to pay
 Now the agreement that we had made
 with all of the
 subcontractors

 Mark Preston's sitting here
 which is testifying for Mitch Roberts
 also did work for me
 and he was treated the same way
 We paid him
 we took his deductions out
 as well as that
 and
 did that
 with everybody
 Okay wai
 That would be fine if that was the agreement
 Now you say that the w
 you under
 Uh yes sir
 Before he went to work
 Okay
 Absolute ly not
 The reason
 and I stress this
 But
 my total
 I agree
 If whatever he just said right there was true
 with withholding and every thing
 R ight I'm
 That was fine
 It really boils down
 But
 The dis cussion

 So that I wouldn't
 So that I wouldn't end up making
 when I had to play my em part of an employer contribution
 I have my own payroll service
 and they're very familiar with all types of pay
 This is why I didn't wanna take the job to begin with
 Uh I can u
 He in turn
 now
 Mister Collins says
 he denies that you said
 everything
 He just
 I wouldn't 've
 You have a different story
 on what the agreement was
 Right
 Um
 Karen here

 and
 she's here to testify about a conversation
 that her and Mitchell had
 and I'd like to
 After the agreement was entered into
 he had been on the job for about a week or so
 and
 I believe for the
 first or second pay period for his men
 Uh he came into the office
 about
 A the payroll
 and B this twenty six percent that we're talking about
 And she'd be hap py to tell you
 why don't you please
 explain the conversation you had with Mister Roberts
 Okay
 he was
 we were going over the wages for Phil Nigel
 who was one of the gentlemen on there
 as to how much Phil was to get
 for the job
 On an hourly basis
 And
 and I said okay
 I take out this amount
 from your check
 And he goes oh
 Well then no
 So we were going back and forth with the figures
 this is the

 wage that we came up with
 And then have seventeen dollars an hour
 taken out of Mitch 's check
 Mitch Roberts' check
 And this is the note that I'd written down on that
 you can see that thirteen fifty plus twenty six percent
 would actually equal to seventeen o one
 You know
 just the seventeen was fine
 Oh this
 So
 I don't
 I had that perfect conversation with her
 And that's very true
 But she never told me anything about
 this twenty six percent
 Why
 It's
 go ahead
 I was offered
 and Matthew offered me the same situation
 And it was my understanding
 that he was to pay everything
 supply
 and pay all of the employer's stuff
 If you're an employer
 You gotta pay all the extra thing s
 you don't have any
 y you can't testify
 Mitch was mak
 M and
 he just mentioned that he
 Matthew just mentioned that he deducted the same out of my check
 MRC He did not MRC
 Prevailing wages
 I saw the people's checks
 and
 I'm just drawing a pi
 H Ma Mister Collins was supposed to pay everything
 He approached him with the same
 Fir f f
 And he d
 Who're all licensed contractors
 But I still
 I still don't know
 He
 it would be
 if it may please you

 the whole reason why I'm here
 Is because he took that twenty six percent out
 he used it as
 more or less bait me to do the job
 and went ahead and withheld it from me
 Without saying a word to it
 I was expecting to make about a thousand dollars on the job
 And
 when he wrote my check
 He wrote my check to me
 handed it to me through a window
 says that's the way it is
 and th
 and and you know
 it wasn't
 and he totally evaded me
 he has to this day evaded me
 Mister Roberts
 That's beside the point
 What I'm trying to
 We have to really hone in on
 If he
 That
 You know
 I don't care if he folded an airplane and ma
 Everything
 But he di
 Well
 WH Okay WH
 But
 you've gotta convince me by a preponderance of evidence
 Well then if
 More
 Now you say one thing
 Then
 when when a person fills out
 why would I become liable
 for that contribution
 When h when he in fact by law
 He's the employer
 I am doing nothing
 Isn't there a law that states that fact
 When you have
 people
 work for you
 stating that
 Wh
 what were the
 Go go through the
 y conversation as you saw it
 Conversation was
 I'll go ahead and pay all your employees
 That was pretty much it
 That's it
 That's to the point
 And he did sir
 And then when it came to the employer contribution
 without my knowledge or anything
 he just yanked that right out of my check
 And Mister Collins
 that conv
 tell me about the conversation you believe happened
 Well
 um
 Mitch and I
 um
 but he wanted to do the work under the basis that I paid his men
 and I told him about
 what I said earlier here
 About the twenty six percent
 Twelve fourteen
 and at
 He was
 made aware of
 the
 were made by the employer
 and we were doing a service for him
 under this agreement that we had between us
 Now just
 just seems from a logical standpoint
 That's cor rect
 Would you
 Why would he do the work
 So you would trick me into doing it
 Tho

 with all my
 with my fourteen years experience
 Why would I do that amount amount of work
 Well I XX
 so I
 I don't
 Well tha t's not
 That's why I turned the d the job down to begin with
 Without doing any work at all
 Well
 if Mister Roberts' testimony is correct he should win
 Now
 for this amount of money
 That's why I turned the job down to begin with
 That's why I'm here in the court today
 to make the court decide
 It shouldn't
 It shouldn't be legal for guys to do this
 Well I'm gonna make


 Now
 I wasn't there
 But
 I'm the one that's bearing the burden of this monetary amount
 you have to bear the burden proving it
 I understand that
 I'm gonna award
 Mister Roberts
 three hundred fifty dollars
 Approximately half
 Now Mister Collins may not like that
 now y
 if he doesn't like it
 Running the risk that he might face
 the full amount of seven hundred and four dollar s
 Okay
 But I'm going to get it
 and award mister Roberts
 three hundred and fifty dollars
 and if neither party is happy
 both parties are unhappy
 So
 Thank you your honor
 Make it for the
 plaintiff of thr ee fifty
 Thank you your honor

 Um
 any of you who find that you really enjoy storytelling
 In Spring Grove Illinois
 children under twelve are free
 Um
 Have any of you ever gone
 I know you have
 Alright

 Uh
 had attended your church a number of times

 from the Illinois storytelling festival
 And
 we would love to have you all come
 There are four tents
 an adult tent
 a general tent
 and then a traditions tent
 world war whatever
 f first time you ever rode in a train
 all of those things
 And I hope that some of you would be able to come
 (COUGH COUGH)
 The next story that I have
 the Native Americans
 It's called how the stars got in the sky
 Did you ever wonder how the stars got in the sky
 This is the way the Indians think that the stars got in the sky
 And I learned this story
 a white man
 In Wisconsin
 he has taken on all of the Native American ways

 And he gave me permission to tell the story
 Long ago
 in the sky there was only the sun and the moon
 And on the nights
 when the moon didn't shine
 Well all of the animals got together
 and decided they were going to go to the creator
 To see if he could help with the problem
 Well
 I will help you
 All of you are to go down to the lake
 And gather stones
 Now not round stones
 but jagged stones
 And when you have got as many as you can carry
 bring them to me
 And so
 all the animals went to the lake
 All except coyote
 Because L coyote was laz y L
 And he was asleep
 So
 And the little animals like grasshopper and bumblebee
 they could only carry one
 But they all brought them to the feet of the creator
 L All except coyote
 he was lazy and
 he was asleep L
 So the creator looked over all the stones that were brought
 and chose one
 Not too large

 and reached up
 and placed it in the sky
 And when he did
 it began to twinkle
 And he said
 this I will call a star
 And this one a special star
 The North Star
 And this evening
 are going to go
 off the edge of the Earth
 into the sky
 With stars
 And so
 that evening
 all of the animals
 and they MRC walked off the edge of the world MRC
 Into the sky
 To make their pictures
 With the brilliant dots
 that would turn into stars
 They all went except coyote
 Because he was lazy
 And he was asleep
 Well after all the animals had gone
 the creator call ed to coyote
 come on now
 Time
 And coyote
 VOX he yawned and VOX
 he got up
 and he VOX dragged himself to the presence of the creator VOX
 and said VOX ye yes
 what do you need me to do VOX
 And the creator said
 But some of them can't carry very many stones
 I want you to take this
 VOX this great big bag of stones into the sky VOX
 then you give them the extras that they need

 L Well
 And he took one look at that bag and thought
 I don't wanna do that VOX
 But you don't argue with the creator

 And so
 got up and he
 took that heavy bag and
 put it on his back and
 he w alked off the edge of the Earth
 Into the sky
 Well he hadn't gone very far
 when that bag started to feel very heavy
 And so he looked one way

 and then he looked the other
 and he put that big bag down
 VOX and then he VOX dug both paws in
 and threw a whole bunch of stones behind him one way
 and a whole bunch the other way

 and then he picked that bag up
 put it on his back again
 Well it wasn't so heavy now
 So he walked a little further
 and a little further
 And he looked one way
 And he looked the other way
 And then he put that bag down
 VOX and he VOX dug in again
 Flung one paw full of stones one way
 one the other way
 and no one had seen him
 But the sky was getting brighter behind him
 He put that bag right up back on his back
 walked a little further
 Well it felt good for about a minute or two
 he just couldn't stand it anymore
 L He looked one way
 he looked the other L
 then he put that bag down
 opened it real wide
 and like a puppy digging a hole
 he just dug
 right out of that bag
 And all those stones
 started sparkling behind him
 Then he took that bag
 made sure it was empty
 folded it up
 made a little pillow
 pulled up a comfortable cloud
 laid down
 and went to sleep
 Well
 VOX coyote
 right over
 Well

 coyote didn't hear them
 Because he was lazy
 and he was
 asleep
 WH Well WH
 the first rays of morning
 and all the animals had to scurry
 back onto the Earth
 Some of them had to leave their pictures
 half done
 Some had only had one stone
 They could just put up in the sky
 A few were finished
 and finally when a ray of light hit coyote in the eye
 he woke up and
 he realized
 So he did
 But that night
 MRC when he looked up at the sky MRC
 that's when he learned how to howl
 Because he saw L all the other animals with their pictures in the sky L
 and MRC his wasn't there MRC
 Because he'd been lazy
 And he had been asleep
 And that's the story
 of how all the stars got in the sky



 Some of my favorite kinds of stories

 A nd this is a story that has a tiger
 And I need you to be the tiger
 Now this tiger keeps changing his mind about things
 sometimes you're going to say
 that's good said tiger
 That's good said tiger

 that tiger changes his mind
 And he says
 that's bad said tiger
 That's bad says tiger
 what keeps flipping this tiger back and forth
 L Boy was sitting on a big rock L
 In the middle of the jungle
 Just sitting
 When along came tiger
 VOX Run boy VOX
 Said tiger
 VOX Run VOX
 VOX I will chase you
 And I will catch you
 And then
 I will eat you
 So run VOX said tiger
 Well said boy
 Eat me then
 I have no run left in me
 VOX What
 You won't run
 Tell me why you won't run
 and then I will eat you VOX
 Said tiger
 Well it's like this said the boy
 I was walking
 Just walking in the jungle when
 I bumped into rhino
 PAR You know what a rhino is
 A great big animal with a horn
 Or rhino bumped into me
 I was willing to forget it
 But not rhino
 So he got mad
 Now this is where you say
 that's good said tiger
 That's good said tiger
 Well I ran
 but all the while
 Running right after me
 He can't see very well but
 boy can he run fast
 That's bad said tiger
 Well I ran and I ran and I ran and I ran
 And I climbed up in that tree
 and I sat on a branch
 and rhino
 he ran right under me
 That's good said tiger
 That's good said tiger
 But
 L he came back looking for me L
 That's bad said tiger
 So I got down
 and I threw it at rhino to scare him away
 That's good said tiger
 But
 L it didn't scare him away L
 Tha t's bad said tiger
 So I got down
 A little slower now

 That's good said tiger
 And then
 then
 right in front of rhino
 That's bad said tiger
 Yes
 but rhino was going so fast this time
 he ran right over me
 That's good said tiger
 But I got up
 and
 there was rhino
 Right there back again
 That's bad said tiger
 So I ran and I ran
 until I saw a vine
 and I grabbed the vine
 That's good said tiger
 But on the other side
 was crocodile
 With his mouth wide open
 That's bad said tiger
 So I swang back
 and I let go of the vine
 and I didn't see rhino anywhere
 That's good said tiger
 So I got down
 and then I realized
 I had been on rhino's back

 Tha
 Tha

 So I got behind a tree
 And I picked up another stone
 rhino can't see very well
 but he heard that stone
 That's good said tiger
 And then tiger said
 And so then
 you ran away
 And boy said
 L well
 No
 I was so tired
 I just sat down here
 and
 and now I'm going to get behind this big stone
 here comes rhino now L

 got up
 P not tired anymore P
 and he ran away home
 P And that's good
 that's bad
 Now I know storytelling is a new thing for a lot of you
 but it
 Um
 if you do have enjoyment of it
 at at the storytelling festival
 I have one more story for you
 And
 How many of you already know the story the frog prince
 The frog prince
 the prince who is
 turned into a frog by a witch
 and then



 I h
 and then in order to regain his form
 be kissed by a beautiful princess
 Well
 this is the story of the other frog prince

 It was a beautiful day at the pond
 But the frog prince
 who was sitting on his lily pad in the middle of the pond
 was he lonely
 I mean the MRC birds were flying above him
 the fish were swimming below him
 but no one was paying a bit of attention to him MRC
 VOX When VOX
 who should he see
 walking along the path with a book under her arm
 but L the most beautiful princess he had ever seen L
 VOX Well
 finally a little company VOX
 He said to himself

 And he took off his little gold crown
 put it next to him on the lily pad
 hopped into the water
 and swam across
 poking his little head up through the reeds
 VOX Oh
 pardon me
 Beautiful princess VOX
 he said in his most pitiful and pathetic voice
 VOX But

 if you could help me VOX
 Well
 the princess was quite surprised to be spoken to by a frog
 but she felt so sorry for his pitiful and pathetic voice
 that she said
 VOX Why
 you dear little frog
 Whatever can I can I do to help you VOX
 And he said
 VOX Oh
 well you see

 I am not really a frog
 I am really a handsome prince
 Who has been turned into a frog by
 the spell of a wicked witch
 And in order to break the spell
 I must be kissed
 by
 a beautiful princess VOX
 Well
 L somehow the princess
 had the feeling that he was gonna say that L
 and felt so sorry for him L
 and she thought
 VOX Well
 What do I have to lose VOX
 VOX And so VOX
 she reached down
 And she picked him up
 and she brought him MRC right up close to her face MRC
 and she closed her eye s
 and she gave him
 a great big kiss
 Do you wanna help me make kiss sounds
 Okay


 But when she opened her eyes
 She was surprised to see
 the frog

 With a great big smile

 And he said
 VOX nice kiss sweetie
 I was just kidding about the prince part

 and he hopped into the water
 And she wiped the frog slime

 VOX Ugh VOX
 And that's the story of the other frog prince

 there are a couple of other storytelling events
 that I'd just like to share with you
 one is in Elgin tomorrow evening

 doing some stories

 and you
 It's a public occasion
 And next Saturday
 at the McHenry County Conservation District
 Um
 Rosalee Sorrells
 who is a well known folk singer and storyteller
 and
 at seven thirty
 We'd love to have you there
 So I thank you very much
 any other group you might belong to
 Thank you very much

 What a great audience
 Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
 It's
 truly a historic occasion today
 to have among us
 a citizen who has contributed so much
 not only to this entire area
 but t to the world of ceramics
 and also to the world of literature
 and been part

 of one of the great artistic movements
 which revolutionized
 the way art was considered
 and which today still has
 extraordinary resonance
 in the work of younger artists
 who are rediscovering
 something that was discovered
 at the v
 and with which Miss Wood
 was so intimately involved
 P XXX P
 To have the Mother of Dada w ith us


 Let's keep XX
 is in deed a pleasure
 I would like to hold forth
 but I don't think I'm going to be allowed to


 Beatrice
 it is yours


 Is my voice alright

 Now
 just mentioned
 It all touched me
 by the name no
 No is the most dangerous word in the English language
 And
 it has absolutely changed my life
 For instance
 I was brought up
 very carefully
 I was a good little girl
 And I was in great revolt
 My mother saw that I had a governess
 that I went to private schools
 and I was in
 I didn't like this at all
 Now
 one day
 I met Elisa
 A journalist
 She knew writers
 she lived a bohemian life
 and I was very attracted
 So I invited her to home
 for luncheon
 After she left
 VOX she's common VOX

 Th at hurt me
 That was first no
 Alright
 I went to see her
 and
 she had a little apartment in Greenwich Village
 there's a young musician
 Who's broken his leg
 you speak French
 So
 and it was Varese
 the musician of the avant garde music
 and
 Marcel Duchamp was there
 The great painter
 of The Nude Descending the Staircase
 Alright
 Marcel Duchamp
 to
 Roche was a collector of art
 and a diplomat
 sent by the French government
 he called on my parents twice
 and after he left
 my mother said
 VOX you're in love with that man

 Alright
 That was her second no

 So
 and I said
 oh
 I'll come to see you
 He said
 it's nothing at all
 I don't mind
 no no no
 it's
 It's not
 I said look
 I'm shopping just around the corner


 I
 m decided
 And I entered his very simple little room
 and I remembered there were very coarse curtains
 and the sun shone through them
 made them like gold
 and I stood in his room
 and he was very nice gentlemanly man
 he didn't quite know what to do
 and he stood opposite me
 And
 I saw a painting on his wall
 a glass of water on the table
 and
 he wasn't saying anything
 So
 finally I looked at him
 VOX aren't you going to show me your etchings VOX
 I was never a good little girl

 it was the kind of life I wanted
 He


 he
 and I met all the great artists of that day
 and had a wonderful time
 I was just I think twenty two
 so
 I was of age

 Now
 I'm very international
 in feeling
 I've traveled quite a good deal
 and
 people are the same everywhere
 of having this feeling for the whole world
 I love that I'm a Californian
 I

 and one of the reasons I love California so much
 is
 that it's kinky
 And

 come up because it's kinky
 And
 it's just wonderful
 the marvelous new ideas that come up
 And of course
 what I like about America
 because
 in spite of being very international in my feeling
 I think ours
 We're quick in friendship
 We are open to new ideas
 We made
 we presented many new inventions
 But
 and this is very serious
 Our


 athletes
 our actors
 And our teachers
 are being cut down
 And our libraries
 MRC This is very very serious MRC
 it's putting a block on knowledge
 China
 and other Middle East country
 Not other Middle East but
 Middle East countries and China
 and other countries
 are realizing the importance of education
 And going after it
 And we
 are cutting down
 And it worries me a great deal
 Now
 One of the wonders of America
 however
 in spite of the bad things
 several years ago

 who taught ceramics
 I think at Mills College
 went to Europe
 To learn
 MRC Europe shares nothing MRC
 America shares
 And because America shares
 Has grown so wonderfully
 We're doing wonderfully inventive things in craft
 Uh
 but
 I've had four very wonderful craftsmen
 to help me
 Lukens at USC
 the Natzlers
 when they first came to America
 would sit by me at the wheel
 and help me try
 to see what throwing was about
 then
 they've been so generous
 they pass down everything
 and
 I remember Toshiko Takaezu
 was visiting me
 she spent a day and a half helping me
 center on the wheel
 MRC All this sharing MRC
 In our schools
 Is a wonderful thing
 So the movements go on
 And of course
 our museums
 Are so important
 I don't know
 if military minded people
 PAR hope nobody from the FBI is here PAR
 if
 the importance of museums
 MRC museums protect all the great art MRC
 The great invention
 The creative efforts of man from the beginning of time
 And
 they're our inspiration
 and I think our museums are doing wonderfully now
 we're beginning to cut down on education
 I
 I feel
 about the importance
 of craft
 Of bringing beauty
 Craft into life
 One day I said to Vivika Heino
 Because I'm a snob about art
 through the museums of Europe
 and my eyes are exposed to great art
 So I said
 VOX you know VOX
 it's a mistake
 to teach
 cr pottery
 in high school
 The students haven't time to make anything beautiful and important
 And Vivika Heino so wisely answered
 that is not the purpose
 It opens them
 To aesthetics
 And that's what right education does
 Now
 I wonder
 We have a tremendous population in prison
 And it's growing
 we can hardly house them
 Why
 We put the cart before the horse
 We put people in prison
 Why
 Because they have MRC not had right education MRC in the beginning
 And right education
 is the basis of everything
 Now ha I'll end with one other idea
 Since there is an Olympic of athletes
 Why not have an Olympic
 of ethnic and tribal dancers
 from countries all over the world
 Then people could come
 and meet
 friendships would be made
 and
 I don't think we can have peace
 just with guns
 Peace comes through friendship
 And friendships would be made
 with all these dancers intermingling
 And even dancing with each other
 Because
 when you touch
 you don't shoot

 And
 I base this
 when I was in
 Ojai
 I would go dancing at the art center
 nobody cared
 who we were dancing with
 or
 a man taking care of trash
 nobody cared
 As long as he was a good dancer
 And after

 we had a party
 And all of us
 mixed together in friendship
 That is wonderful
 And
 If we had great dances
 So
 I come back
 my last word is
 violence
 never ends
 with violence
 And right education
 is the basis
 of everything

 Well


 Because if the State Depart
 Okay
 F I hope that there is someone from the FBI here



 Miss Wood asked me to inform everyone
 that her hearing was rather difficult
 and so

 I'm very hard of hearing
 Age

 s
 the beginning

 And


 Who would like
 Yes
 Beatrice
 when did you first get

 into a living relationship in Paris
 W w F when did you get into a living relationship
 with those p artists in Paris
 at what age F
 With artists in Par is
 Um
 I went to study art in Paris
 A little bit
 But I really didn't meet any answers
 and to answer your question the way I think you would like it answered


 In New York

 Mhm





 really
 b b bothered
 By her remarks
 That I just broke loose
 in the direction I wanted
 She wanted
 Social life
 Have me married to a stock bro ker
 Oh




 And I think I was very lucky
 three
 oh four friends
 to help my education
 Marcel Duchamp
 the collectors
 and then
 my old schoolmate
 Hapgood was co
 was editor of Collier's
 a close friend of President Wilson
 and Elizabeth herself
 spoke Russian
 So she knew
 Uh

 it was

 Pavlova

 Isadora Duncan
 all those people
 I met through my own schoolmate
 Elizabeth Hapgood
 So I have been very lucky
 Another question
 You fear I'll tell the truth


 after you broke away from her
 F How was your relationship with your mother
 Um
 I broke away

 I wasn't really
 too interested
 But
 I thought it was the only way I could earn money
 And I threatened my mother to run away
 so she said
 And you can study under the Comedie
 Comedie Francaise
 Because she thought
 that if I acted in French
 it was safer

 in America
 I

 I was acting in the French theatre
 then I
 I spoke perfect French

 for two years
 But I want to MRC act in English MRC
 And my good friend
 so many people in the theatre
 I got many parts offered me
 VOX No
 You get leading lady
 part of me was really
 a good little girl
 so I was very subdued
 And
 No
 You can't do that
 And then
 a woman came from Canada
 And said
 To Canada
 and act in the theatre there
 On salary
 And I said yes
 And that's
 when I broke
 with my home
 And
 had a nervous breakdown for two days
 VOX you're killing your mother VOX
 and I said
 VOX she's killing me VOX
 And I'm the younger

 where I am
 Now


 and very generous
 but she was in a way of thinking
 we didn't have radio
 life wasn't as open as it is now
 And
 would want
 social life for their daughter
 Probably
 Now

 when she died
 in thirty six
 I had left home then
 The last three months of her life we became friends
 And she let go
 Of all that kind of thing
 and she was very wonderful
 and open
 and the last day of her life
 conscious
 we joked about it
 and
 I understand there's a wonderful exhibition
 don't tell any of the others
 but go see it
 she was just wonderful
 So I'm very happy to be say
 To s be able to say
 we became friends
 At the end
 Mhm
 Yes

 about your thoughts on
 bringing art to the prisons
 F Could you explain
 about bringing art to the prisons
 to the prisons F
 I think it'd be wonderful
 Uh
 I've always been
 concerned about people being in prison
 but I really don't know
 very much
 I just think it's a terrible thing
 That we have so many
 And I'm sure
 we could s
 what is called save the lives
 of endless people
 if they had a creative outlet
 But what is a young person to do
 Brought up
 not knowing in any way right from wrong
 seeing bing bing bing
 guns used all the time
 drugs
 why should they not steal
 Now
 I don't know if this has any value
 When I left home
 in name only
 But the man
 MRC without any money MRC
 And I mean
 I sold w my own books
 to get money to eat
 to be
 I was not trained for the world
 I didn't know
 how to relate to the world
 But
 and
 they never said anything
 My mother said
 she always had a very good

 Suspecting
 And I was
 One day she said
 go up to my room
 and get some information out of my purse
 I went there
 it was full of money
 And
 I had the impulse to take some
 I knew she wouldn't care
 she probably sent me up almost to take some
 And I stood
 And then something in me said
 no
 That is MRC not the way to live MRC
 And I didn't take it
 Now
 But
 when you have no education
 I'd read a great deal
 also a lot of trash
 But I'd enjoyed readings

 Why shouldn't you steal
 Why shouldn't you go to prison
 But look what we're paying for people in prison
 instead of putting this
 into education
 You see
 our culture
 MRC misses the first sell MRC
 Which I come back I say
 And of course
 from what I know
 so I say this with apology
 but I understand
 that it's vital
 MRC For women to love their infants MRC
 And from what I've read
 all criminals
 it's because they've never been loved as young
 youngsters
 Yes
 hear something about
 the Mother of Dada
 F How did you become the Mother of Dada F

 VOX Do you smell the dog on me
 Yeah
 Okay
 Down boy VOX
 Mm kay
 Jamie wrote this out
 in a hurry this morning
 Yeah
 gotten a brand inspection done
 But then she said she didn't know where it was and
 that's what he wanted to know
 P he
 then he would have to go off of that one
 P Trash P
 then he could just go off of this
 If
 Well
 She
 Oh
 But
 if she didn't
 I wouldn't know
 I just need
 or if she didn't
 He said
 sh he'll just go off the papers
 And this
 These papers here
 Unhu nh
 And I sent in the Arab papers to be

 They haven't been transferred
 I don't know how many owners she's had
 But it hasn't
 Wow
 You don't remember the name of the people you bought her from
 No
 but then that's not un usual
 cause I

 Pay the bills
 I'm
 I
 I earn the the money to pay the bills
 she
 I do the hard labor
 make arenas
 shovel manure
 that's about it

 Well I really like this pony
 She's gonna go competitive trail riding
 Do the novice
 So this eleven year old's horse is a little bit big for her
 and she's gonna take the pony
 she's
 Through water
 That's great
 And all the kids had to do was get her through

 And
 So
 Uh
 now how do you
 get on a trail ride at the Air Force Academy
 Well
 We just load the horses in a trailer home
 That's neat
 And head over
 They have real pretty trails
 We just drove around
 I was showing Matt
 Oh where's he from
 He's from UC Santa Barbara
 University of California Santa Barba ra
 And what's his name
 Matt
 Matt and
 he he he's back on the airplane tomorrow morning
 so we were driving around and
 went to the Air Force Academy and
 Took him over to Garden of the Gods
 okay
 and
 WH Let's see WH
 She gave me two of those
 and one for her to keep
 Do you wanna just write on here
 And fifty bucks
 And then we're
 paid by
 We'll be done with it

 Uh

 And fifty dollars will be paid
 And then write paid in full
 Right
 Twenty four May
 ninety four

 And then just initial it
 Yeah
 Okay
 Now I better do that on the other one too
 Okay

 I like your signature

 WH Yeah WH
 Yeah she's even got a boyfriend
 The little Morgan Gelding
 He's been lonesome for
 the last year or so
 Since he's
 he was

 One of these you get to keep
 And
 I guess that's it hunh
 Righ t
 Th en it
 Okay
 And then I would need it
 or need some way to look it up
 It gets ki nda screwy
 And they look like this
 In

 PAR Let's see if I've got a permanent one here with me
 I bet not PAR
 What happened to Matt
 I don't know

 Uh
 Co
 she's lovely
 Oh Fan cy
 Beautiful pony
 Horse
 Nah I don't have any permanents here

 P Department of Agriculture
 I guess
 Okay
 Ye ah
 That's P
 Well it' s
 S tate Board of Stock Inspection
 You know it doesn't cost much to do it
 and
 You leaving
 pull your horse in h
 He was dancing on the end of the lead rope
 And arch
 but he did it on the way up back too
 Oh
 He had his neck arched


 Look how much is done now
 No
 That's my roommate Karen
 Okay
 Is
 Well I never know what you're gonna do from week to week


 Okay

 Who's supposed to do this
 or what
 I don't know
 I think the seller is supposed to
 P Oh P
 Usually the seller's supposed to pay for it
 I just do it and I pay for it
 To do it
 P Okay P
 But
 if she ha
 I mean it's not a big deal
 I just need to know if she had one done or didn't have one done
 If she did have one done
 So they can look it up
 And I doubt if they're terribly computerized

 but I remembered the month that I bought it in
 And I happened to buy it out at the auction
 It was one of my
 The Substitute Wife
 Oh
 Was that any good
 Didn't we see
 Well it was funny
 No

 Too many teeth and hair


 Well
 Th
 Yeah
 Okay
 P I have no idea
 And s
 I'm the
 Okay I'm the agent
 The a I was the agent on this horse
 I'm not the owner
 So
 But course
 The
 So it's been almost a year
 I just
 I just can't bear to bring the brand inspector out for just one horse
 he's getting a permanent brand inspection
 Which you can keep
 for the
 What is a brand inspection
 But it's
 What it is is your MRC only legal bill of sale MRC
 for horse or cattle
 in the State of Colo rado
 Oh
 Regis tration
 Right
 And and
 Or or
 not registering
 but
 passing title
 Mhm
 see the thing is
 is if you don't have a legal brand inspection
 On a horse when you take him to the auction
 So
 JULIE a little bill of sale that looks like this
 and steals a horse out of my pasture
 Look for identifying marks
 And not send that horse to the kil lers
 Okay
 Yeah
 How do you
 I guess you just look it up in the phone book
 for
 Well you u sually you can you can

 of the brand inspector
 His name is
 our our current brand inspector is a real cutie
 Bart Zuckerman
 Is our current brand inspector
 Okay
 his answering machine wasn't working
 Okay
 But

 he is a cutie
 I mean he he's
 Really nice looking young fellow
 I don't know
 He's got
 But
 Polite cowboy type

 And on our last

 And
 I mean
 I'd go through seven eight horses a year out here and
 Well
 cause I'm an
 I teach riding lessons
 I'll
 that
 And so I act as an agent
 So you match a a a customer with a horse
 that you can do this
 Well m
 And when they're ready to buy a horse
 Like with Peggy's horse
 And she's a wonderful horse
 And I didn't even dicker on the price for her

 And she was a nine year old Anglo Arab
 Um

 And the mare's real cute
 the fox hunt and hunts her all winter
 We just chase em

 We have several scars in this barn
 from people bouncing off of trees
 Golly day
 It's it's not
 That sounds like fun though
 It's not a sport for the timid
 You've gotta be pretty brave
 Or stu pid

 I've never done it
 W

 Well let me show you my barn
 I've
 Oh your brother's sitting in his car
 Why is he do ing that
 He's
 He's just recording conversations

 They're not for content

 Making a m massive database
 Come on dogs
 Dogs
 Come on

 Ask him if he'd like to come see the barn
 Matt
 You wanna see the barn
 Sure
 Let me give you this
 Oh
 just taking it easy here
 Here you go
 It's down here
 The barn's new XX
 Well that's a big dog
 Or is this a horse
 Puppy

 It's a puppy
 Oh yeah
 What kind is he
 XX
 Great Dane
 He was left starving and sick at my vet's clinic for
 pretty bad shape
 They picked him up and I adopted him from the Humane Society
 He weighed seventy two pounds
 and now he weighs a hundred and fifty
 XXX Christmas gift

 He

 Seventy two
 And now he's
 He was
 Oh
 Mm
 So what were
 XX


 Yeah
 Mm
 And I don't want him to get that big
 That's Hap
 He's one of those wild thoroughbreds
 Yeah
 He's a boarder
 I now own
 I bo ard
 I only own five of em now
 and two of them are somewhere else
 My mare and foal are down the hill
 What is that
 Oh
 Yeah
 I have
 Well I feed between twenty and twenty five horses all year round


 I go through
 They have trucks come out here
 Yeah I go through about three hundred pounds a day
 Oh man

 I go through ten
 Ten to twelve tons of hay a month
 Roughly
 You must have been hurting this last season
 my hay supplier was real good to me
 How did you do that
 I mean it was hard for everybody
 and I don't
 but I've been re al steady and real loyal
 We had a r
 and I've referred him to a lotta people
 And
 we had a
 He kept my hay price
 Because of
 He
 It was the floods out in
 But see he knows how much
 And he buys hay
 And actually I usually get the Wyoming hay
 and it got ruined in the rain
 But not quite as good
 But he kept my hay price down to a hundred and twenty five dollars a ton
 Which is how much
 All win ter
 Delivered and stacked
 Was that a
 What does that boil down to per bale
 that came and picked it up
 for a hundred and sixty five
 A ton
 But I get twenty two to twenty five tons at a time

 What does that b oil down to per b ale
 No
 No it
 It's roughly
 anywhere from twenty eight to thirty

 bales per ton
 But
 Yeah
 See there's Shiba
 VOX Hey Shiba VOX

 VOX Come here girl VOX

 Are you sleepy
 And that's her boyfriend Beamer
 He's so
 Hm

 He thinks that's wonderful
 Shiba's been in heat
 See how she
 Squirting on him
 Oh yuck

 He likes it
 This one's in heat too
 Cause poor mare
 Beamer rushes the fence
 pins his ears at her
 because he d
 He doesn't want her to get next to his mare
 and that one
 who might threaten his mare herd

 I give lessons on him too
 his owner doesn't ride him much
 He
 He
 he rides Western English and drives
 And he's just as cute as can be
 They're identical color aren't they
 And she's just sure that this one's going to be it
 Actually h e's doing better than my stallion


 He's only three
 And we tried breeding him to a mare the other day



 A gay stallion
 Oh I said
 And he's real even tempered but
 We just had his first foal
 And I just turned em out to pasture together for three days
 and she was patient with him
 Hm
 But then he fell in love with her and it was

 He was
 Um
 what do you call it
 He only wanted the one mare
 He wouldn't look at any of the others last year
 rush at her WH
 See if he goes
 See and her buddy

 And her
 pal of ten ye
 He just was so crippled up and old and
 she didn't want to keep the mare at home
 after they put the other horse down
 cause she figured she'd get frantic
 To make friend s
 Yeah
 Well these are
 Um
 well last year I put in a whole new ring
 I
 I'd had it leveled when I moved here
 but it w really wasn't level
 And the sand that I had in it
 It had all washed down the road
 So it was hard as a rock
 WH WH
 like riding on asphalt
 So
 Well you were probably down to the hardpack
 I was down to clay
 And I had Havens come out
 and
 And p ut it down in that corner
 Yeah
 And
 it just was a lot nicer
 three hundred tons of sand brought in and spread
 It was great in the winter time
 but when it thawed
 we couldn't ride in it
 So today
 and take the rest of the sand off
 and his son
 He was taking it to one of my students
 who lives on the road behind me
 So she got a great deal
 that I paid
 and she got it a
 And so it was a lot cheaper than if she'd bought it
 a buck
 a buck a ton
 Yeah
 The hauling is what costs so much
 But I'll sh
 So uh
 yeah
 My
 my arena isn't very level
 Well it cost her a lot less to level hers
 or as unlevel
 This is my tractor
 It's masquerading as an Isuzu
 But it really is my tractor

 My handyman did that
 That's my roommate
 he's hiding
 And then
 this is the field
 and then that's the gelding field
 And Bruge stands here half the day wanting to come in

 And the Chestnut
 And then a chestnut with his tail to us
 Yeah
 The chestnut is my stallion
 And he's just as mellow as
 He's mellower than most geldings
 And the mare and baby
 are up the road
 If you go through the gateposts
 And just go through there and look to your left
 And we've got
 Right now we're down to twenty horses here
 Which is great
 And then
 my roommate's old horse is going out to pasture the first of the month too
 He's
 had a real rough year
 he lost one eye
 and this'll probably be his last summer and
 So we'll put him out to pasture and let him eat grass for a summer
 and
 And if he's
 if he's
 looks like he's gonna lose the sight in the other eye totally
 we'll put him down in the fall
 I'm not gonna let him wander around blind
 It's not fair to him
 He's been a grand horse
 But none of ours go to the killers at the end of their life
 Where do they go
 They get put down
 and then either buried or just hauled off
 But we put em down at home
 I don't
 I don't put them through going out to the sale and
 being menh manhandled
 I just
 don't believe in that
 That's probably why I'll always be poor
 But I do a lotta horse rescue
 this black horse of my roommate's came from
 he was going to the killer's four years ago
 Not this one
 The one that is b blind now
 And he was considered a killer
 An unmanageable
 And he's been perfectly lovely
 Hm
 So
 I've had him four years
 Sold him to my roommate a couple years ago
 it was her second horse
 And
 they've cleaned up in competitive trail and
 fox hunted him and
 He's just real game
 And he's just great
 And
 an nother one I saved from the killers
 the light chestnut with the blond tail swishing at us
 Yeah
 He's a mustang
 and he was way down on the sales list
 So I m
 I said he's VOX gonna make a wonderful hunt horse

 And he did
 And he's absolutely lovely
 hunter jumper
 Naytrack
 and she hunts him
 That's great
 We tried driving him
 I used to h h
 putting
 Driving him with a cart
 Oh

 making you pull a wagon
 Yes
 There's
 He's about a quarter Belgian
 And he came from around Reno Nevada
 And
 and I had this guy come out that drives Belgians and
 and he was gonna put in fence posts
 he said VOX well I don't have anything else to do VOX
 And he asked me what I'd done to him and

 Baby Bel
 So he put the harness on
 cause I don't know as
 that much about it
 And
 I said when this horse spooks
 it's a pretty tremendous spook
 VOX I said and you don't want him to spook VOX
 He said VOX nah
 He hooked him to the cart
 He got in
 bucked
 kicked the guy out of the cart
 took off
 Um

 And I had a different gate
 Because
 He came out the end of the barn
 jumped a four and a half foot g ate

 The cart of course
 And he went tearing around this whole field
 for probably ten minutes
 With paraphernalia
 probably straps hanging to him
 The cart was still attached

 The cart went through the gate
 Gee
 The c the cart went through the gate
 I
 It was one of the alum inum type type gates

 And it was flat
 And
 But he went tearing around
 used to be a part of a fence
 See the part tha
 It just makes kind of a upside down U
 But the cart knocked it over
 And sent that all flying
 And finally the cart's wheels got smashed enough
 and he was dragging dead weight
 and I was going h oly cow
 and he got trampled by the other horses
 And he liked it
 Real strange
 VOX Give me my Bute VOX

 But he got tram
 And another horse
 was permanently lame after th
 borderline lame anyway
 an old lame Appaloosa
 He just
 On the hill
 and just
 He broke off a piece of his side bone
 So he's retired totally now
 Just getting fat and not working
 Mm
 And
 but
 So much for carts
 I walked up there
 and
 hoping he wouldn't run over me
 And I took a knife with me
 and I was a
 And
 he h
 The only injury he had
 the shaft was under his belly
 He had a puncture wound on the back of his forearm here
 Small tiny puncture wound
 He did a lotta bruising and muscle da mage
 And
 the vet happened to be out
 yeah I think he was
 he'll be out for six weeks
 Which was the b rest of the hunt season
 He hunted two weekends later

 And for three week s
 P How are you P
 after I took
 When I take the cay hay cart out
 To feed the horses
 They'd all run and scare and spook

 I'll be darned
 I tell you what
 Forget that cart
 I don't need
 Um
 shoot
 I need to go now
 Okay
 I'll just ride Canso tomorrow
 I can stay after the lesson and work some
 God I didn't know it was so late
 It's o kay
 That's right
 Anyway
 Okay
 And then then I have another barn down here and
 These are the turn outs
 But it's pretty well arranged
 I'm her slave

 Like so
 Just like you would in a regular
 Sode makikomi

 I want to really get that lift
 As I get that lift

 you can
 From here
 I don't have
 But from here

 I get more of a spring off with it
 It's gonna be hard not to call it an ippon

 And even if they don't
 I'm going right into Ude garami
 Go

 Not bad
 Lug
 Try it on Bill
 You're in front of a Black Belt
 XX where he can see if he wants to
 Oh
 Alright

 Gotta pull going this way
 Okay
 I need to have him here
 You don't have to g wrap both arms up
 Just one really
 jerk him around
 and then spring the hip up
 Take a high collar grip Lug
 you wouldn't start off like that
 You can just swing all the way around
 Just
 No
 There's no such thing as a Hane uchi mata
 You fall straight on your face
 Oh
 Alright
 you don't have the outer pull going for you
 You still don't have enough outer pull
 He oughtta be wound up on his tiptoes
 Way out to here
 Spring your hip
 It's hard too
 for you
 Try it again
 And Martin if your hip joints were okay
 Yeah
 He'd b be just perfect for you to
 okay
 Okay
 Watch
 From here
 From right here
 Okay
 Jock him into it
 Mhm
 from here
 See that half half instep
 Spot the hip
 I'm jerking
 I still get under him don't I

 Then I'm on him
 It's hard to control that throw
 Did you land off the mat
 No no
 Uchi mother

 Tell you what
 Martin let's pull this down XXX
 Okay
 Alright
 Lug
 Give a more upward
 round pull
 From here
 Watch
 I get s
 best best way to do it is to feel it I guess
 Bend over
 Alright
 now I jerk up
 first
 then I spin around
 Okay
 And I'm gonna let it go

 Then I'm gonna let go here
 see how I got you wound up

 This is not a good throw to throw Lug in


 I would suggest doing this throw
 on combatants and opponents of equal height
 And size
 Lug would be much better
 for a Sode makikomi
 but not a Hande maki Hane makikomi
 Cause the Hane
 you add that spring
 Alright
 I'm having to use my legs
 to throw his weight
 Instead of using Sode maki komi
 and get the outside of his legs
 and I can make that a pretty throw
 Alright
 And with the Makikomi technique with it
 you don't have
 the Tsuri komi
 The lifting pull
 You don't have your right hand to help you with it
 All you have is an outer winding pull with the left hand
 It's gotta go up
 out
 and around
 Let's give it a try
 Throw throw Bill again

 Now

 That's better
 Much better
 Now let's throw it again
 and think about where the foot goes
 Now
 Just one moment
 The more acute angle
 that that knee gets at
 the more MRC power w you have with your spring MRC from your hip joint
 From here
 even if I'm doing Hane goshi
 if I get that
 that knee bent
 well I can blast him
 from here

 I've got a lot of spring with it
 Also
 lay the instep of the foot
 Toes extremely well pointed
 To the inside
 of his calf
 I mean his
 his thigh
 I don't care if your heel slides up into his crotch
 For a a Hane makikomi
 Now

 Hane goshi
 I'd prefer that you do it a little bit different
 the higher up it gets
 Yoshi
 Is this the right position here
 Your knees need to be bent
 Now pull
 and spr and spring
 Spring
 Okay
 I'm just trying to get this
 even though he's bent over
 I still have to get in
 Okay
 Look at his look at his heels
 Is his heel up
 Yes
 Alright from here
 now I've g I'm got to be lower
 come on back side of the hands

 And then I spring him off
 If he's bent over
 it's extremely hard for me to get under him
 with a standard Tsuri komi grip
 Well this way I'm just scooting my butt in there on him
 It doesn't matter if I hit him
 a little bit above my his obi
 with my buttocks
 As long as
 that leg is automatically cocking as it goes in
 Then I'm throwing my weight straight forward
 With that outer winding pull
 It's all important
 Jerk him around

 Okay
 Bill went into Uchi mata
 I might have to have you throw Uchi mata a couple times
 Think of it
 as a very short
 inverted kick
 Like that
 You know how you can use

 inverted kick
 Up very close range
 That's exactly what you're doing

 Kicking the inside of his thigh
 Okay
 This time do an inverted kick on the inside of his thigh when you do it
 Go into it and load him up two or three times
 Uchi komi
 Alright
 Bend your knees as you go in too
 You're just straight and
 'S better
 Now throw


 Relax and throw

 You're still sliding up that leg
 Bill
 Throw me

 Thank you

 Okay it was
 Now I'm gonna be a sucker
 This
 Now you're just walking in on me man
 Jerk me to you
 Hoo
 Not quite far enough in
 A little shaky
 as long as you're getting my head
 to where it'll clear
 Make me a happy camper
 Ah
 here
 an added exp
 an added attraction
 What are we gonna do now
 I've got my hand on your hip
 There we go
 That's it beau
 Throw


 I was gonna get that arm free

 Stop whispering
 Good
 One of these
 You will
 Think I did

 Mhm
 Turn on in on s with something
 Turn in to anything
 Can't
 Now I'm playing you back
 But
 F Oh F
 Hane makikomi now

 Boy that's a hard fall

 Ippon

 Now
 the traditional way to do it
 is not all bent over
 It's from a regular grip
 And I'll still go


 Not a real
 Which w that one wasn't a very clean pretty throw
 XX functional
 Ah f
 had my leg stayed lower
 Traditional Hane
 Hane
 Goshi leg

 That was pretty
 But I like the Hane makikomi
 when it's used on a player
 who's fighting you in that
 extreme defensive stance
 While he's down in a deep jigo
 Preferably
 with his left foot forward
 Pressing against you with that left hand
 Keeping you out
 Doing this number
 Goes in
 see he's already eliminated this place

 All you have to do is jerk me around to it and come to me
 Jerk
 Hook
 And then spring me right there
 That's it
 Alright
 Think if you tried the throw
 WH Okay WH
 Can you tell
 On Darren
 Lug's a little bit heavy for you
 Where is he
 Here it is
 Don't throw him off the mat now Bill
 Do we wanna do it using
 Yeah
 Ah the only thing I
 Take your position on the mat
 All I do is XXX

 I'm keeping you out like that
 Well that's fine down
 Are they on the chalk
 Okay
 You gonna make XX XXX

 Well
 Was I above your leg
 It did
 It's not the time for
 for extreme resistance yet
 We're in practice
 Okay
 Just put your hand up there
 P XX P
 Not a lot of resistance from it
 P XXX XXXX
 XXX XXX P
 Thank you
 Cause you're throwing him over toward this edge
 Okay

 Pu
 Alright
 Lug let's see you throw
 throw Bill
 Turn and bow to that Brown Belt
 I did
 Okay I didn't see you
 Throw


 Man that would have been as fine as frog's hair
 Throw

 The o the only way that you're gonna get it Lug
 is to keep practicing it
 Alright
 now
 hook the arm
 hook the arm here
 All the way
 and just shoot this on across
 Now go
 Throw

 There
 You're still shooting up
 with a bit of a
 Uchi mata
 Now I'm gonna throw him with left side
 It doesn't matter
 Alright
 now I'm just gon gonna shoot it to here

 Now I'm coming in with my knees bent
 Yeah but that makes
 Yeah but an elbow in my f
 Don't worry about it son
 And from the right hand side
 Bend over
 Put your hand against my hip
 Hold me out
 Okay
 Alright from here
 I just come
 just like this
 I don't have to try to grab him around the head
 I shoot this hand down and I
 With this shoulder

 All I'm doing is my
 Then I've got him all locked up
 now I'm good and tight against your chest Darren
 Uh
 Well
 Am I tight against your chest
 One of the secrets about making this throw work
 Bend over Bill
 put your hand there
 Alright from here
 I'm gonna roll it around here
 See how I got my chest
 Have I got your chest Bill
 But my butt is in it
 Oh

 Textbook
 is the
 legs
 Try it on me
 Up now

 Alright I'm right here
 S get over here
 Alright Lug
 swing that arm out of your way
 Swing it all the way around
 That's fine
 I think you're going to go

 a m
 a
 Sode makikomi
 This is just what it feels like from this position
 So I'm gonna get ready to step over
 O kay
 And just as I get ready to step from here
 kick that leg in


 There I go
 Alright come here Bill
 Watch it Darren
 I mean
 Benton
 Alright
 tell me if this
 you know
 Sode makikomi
 Now
 there we go
 no
 just don't counter
 There
 Alright now
 I can finish up
 He off mat
 No
 he just hit his hand
 Oh




 I guess since he's off the mat
 he didn't wanna hurt his arm s
 He's used to wearing a watch
 try and protect it
 Come throw him a little bit Benton
 There
 Now th
 shoot it now
 YELL Ha YELL
 You had a perfect position with the foot
 XXX
 Jed
 in the front
 XXX
 I've noticed something that your sensei is doing that you're not doing
 He's reaching for the mat
 He's in there and winds up
 he's reaching for the mat
 with this arm
 And your arm's way up here high
 and your sensei
 is VOX way down like this VOX
 See the difference
 So you're wrapping
 and you're thinking
 and Nick
 is going for the mat with this arm
 He's into a f
 almost like a forward roll mode
 The other difference that I noticed between you and your sensei is that
 this foot is way out here
 This the
 your
 Are they trying to throw over the entire hip se ction
 with th
 And and and and
 so pretty like he does
 his foot
 of his opponent's center of gravity

 S you're so wide that
 when you lift up to make the springing motion
 what happens is
 That is it
 enough to go like that
 Try it one time
 Reach for the ground with your wrapping arm
 Uh
 Better there
 Yeah
 Reach
 reach way into the ground with this one
 Here here here's
 it's right here
 Reach VOX way like this VOX
 And and stand on this foot
 are more balanced
 Just a little bit more
 Step in when you have his b
 No step deeper
 Won't settle
 Step deeper
 Okay
 Look how d
 Now
 Get your foot over here
 Bit more
 That foot
 Now
 Oh
 Ah so

 Try it again
 Alright
 what hi
 what
 Mhm
 Step directly between his legs
 No no no no no
 not between his leg s

 The more you reach that arm through
 L let me add one
 to make it
 throwing it contest style
 somebody once told me
 that that
 all the Makikomi waza
 was to go down like this
 and to take this foot
 and stick it VOX all the way through VOX l ike thi s
 And just stick it
 All the way
 behind you
 like this
 and you roll like that
 and if you do this
 in demo fashion
 you'll be so low to the ground
 by the time that your opponent hits the ground
 And that way I mean
 you can intensify
 throw it harder
 But the mark of a good judo throw
 is to be able to
 they can do
 and it doesn't even hurt
 So you can do that
 by sticking that leg
 all the way through
 just like that
 As you get
 You follow what I'm saying
 Yes sir
 You don't have to drive em through the mat
 that's a way that you can
 practice it over and over
 and be so low to the ground
 it's about as good as you can get a Makikomi for your uke
 It's really not that bad
 And you could
 it's it's
 Throw him
 and let him see
 Alright
 coming in like this

 alright
 Look at his body position right here
 There is no
 You couldn't slide a postcard between us
 I don't think you'd even do it between the hip
 to to get the hips
 Well do you wanna do one more
 Yeah
 Here's a nice place to put my shoe s
 Yeah there it is
 Mom look
 Unhunh what
